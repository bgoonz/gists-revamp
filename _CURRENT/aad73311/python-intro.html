      Python syntax was made for readability, and easy editing. For example, the
      python language uses a <code>:</code> and indented code, while javascript
      and others generally use <code>{}</code> and indented code.

      Lets create a
      <a href="https://repl.it/languages/python3">python 3</a> repl, and call it
      <em>Hello World</em>. Now you have a blank file called <em>main.py</em>.
      Now let us write our first line of code:
    </p>
    <p><em>helloworld.py</em></p>
    <pre class="text"><code>print(&#39;Hello world!&#39;)</code></pre>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Brian Kernighan actually wrote the first “Hello, World!” program as part
        of the documentation for the BCPL programming language developed by
        Martin Richards.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Now, press the run button, which obviously runs the code. If you are not
      using replit, this will not work. You should research how to run a file
      with your text editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you look to your left at the console where hello world was just
      printed, you can see a <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>, or
      <code>$</code> depending on what you are using. After the prompt, try
      typing a line of code.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>Python 3.6.1 (default, Jun 21 2017, 18:48:35)

Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt; print(&#39;Testing command line&#39;)
Testing command line
&gt; print(&#39;Are you sure this works?&#39;)
Are you sure this works?
&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
      The command line allows you to execute single lines of code at a time. It
      is often used when trying out a new function or method in the language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another cool thing that you can generally do with all languages, are
      comments. In python, a comment starts with a <code>#</code>. The computer
      ignores all text starting after the <code>#</code>.
    </p>
    <p><em>shortcom.py</em></p>
    <pre class="text"><code># Write some comments!</code></pre>
    <p>
      If you have a huge comment, do <strong>not</strong> comment all the 350
      lines, just put <code>'''</code> before it, and <code>'''</code> at the
      end. Technically, this is not a comment but a string, but the computer
      still ignores it, so we will use it.

print(&#39;Testing&#39;)</code></pre>
    <p>
      Unlike many other languages, there is no <code>var</code>,
      <code>let</code>, or <code>const</code> to declare a variable in python.
      You simply go <code>name = 'value'</code>.
    </p>
    <p><em>vars1.py</em></p>
    <pre class="text"><code>x = 5
y = 7
z = x*y # 35
print(z) # =&gt; 35</code></pre>
    <p>
      Remember, there is a difference between integers and strings.
      <em>Remember: String = <code>""</code>.</em> To convert between these two,
      you can put an int in a <code>str()</code> function, and a string in a
      <code>int()</code> function. There is also a less used one, called a
      float. Mainly, these are integers with decimals. Change them using the
      <code>float()</code> command.
    </p>
    <p><em>vars2.py</em></p>
    <pre class="text"><code>x = 5
x = str(x)
b = &#39;5&#39;
b = int(b)
print(&#39;x = &#39;, x, &#39;; b = &#39;, str(b), &#39;;&#39;) # =&gt; x = 5; b = 5;</code></pre>
    <p>
      Instead of using the <code>,</code> in the print function, you can put a
      <code>+</code> to combine the variables and string.
    </p>
    <p>There are many operators in python:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>+</code></li>
      <li><code>-</code></li>
      <li><code>/</code></li>
      <li>
        <code>*</code> These operators are the same in most languages, and allow
        for addition, subtraction, division, and multiplicaiton. Now, we can
        look at a few more complicated ones:
      </li>
      <li><code>%</code></li>
      <li><code>//</code></li>
      <li><code>**</code></li>
      <li><code>+=</code></li>
      <li><code>-=</code></li>
      <li><code>/=</code></li>
      <li><code>*=</code> Research these if you want to find out more…</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>simpleops.py</em></p>
    <pre class="text"><code>x = 4
a = x + 1
a = x - 1
a = x * 2
a = x / 2</code></pre>
    <p>
      You should already know everything shown above, as it is similar to other
      languages. If you continue down, you will see more complicated ones.
    </p>
    <p><em>complexop.py</em></p>
    <pre class="text"><code>a += 1
a -= 1
a *= 2
a /= 2</code></pre>
    <p>
      The ones above are to edit the current value of the variable.<br />
      Sorry to JS users, as there is no <code>i++;</code> or anything.

      You can look at only certain parts of the string by slicing it, using
      <code>[num:num]</code>.<br />
      The first number stands for how far in you go from the front, and the
      second stands for how far in you go from the back.

      Python has created a lot of functions that are located in other .py files.
      You need to import these <strong>modules</strong> to gain access to the,,
      You may wonder why python did this. The purpose of separate modules is to
      make python faster. Instead of storing millions and millions of functions,
      , it only needs a few basic ones. To import a module, you must write
      <code>input &lt;modulename&gt;</code>. Do not add the .py extension to the
      file name. In this example , we will be using a python created module
      named random.
    </p>
    <p><em>module.py</em></p>
    <pre class="text"><code>import random</code></pre>
    <p>
      Now, I have access to all functions in the random.py file. To access a
      specific function in the module, you would do
      <code>&lt;module&gt;.&lt;function&gt;</code>. For example:
    </p>
    <p><em>module2.py</em></p>
    <pre class="text"><code>import random
print(random.randint(3,5)) # Prints a random number between 3 and 5</code></pre>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Pro Tip:<br />
        Do <code>from random import randint</code> to not have to do
        <code>random.randint()</code>, just <code>randint()</code><br />
        To import all functions from a module, you could do
        <code>from random import *</code>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Loops allow you to repeat code over and over again. This is useful if you
      want to print Hi with a delay of one second 100 times.
    </p>
    <p><strong>for Loop</strong></p>
    <p>
      The for loop goes through a list of variables, making a seperate variable
      equal one of the list every time.<br />
      Let’s say we wanted to create the example above.
    </p>
    <p><em>loop.py</em></p>
    <pre class="text"><code>from time import sleep
for i in range(100):
     print(&#39;Hello&#39;)
     sleep(.3)</code></pre>
    <p>
      This will print Hello with a .3 second delay 100 times. This is just one
      way to use it, but it is usually used like this:
    </p>
    <p><em>loop2.py</em></p>
    <pre class="text"><code>import time
for number in range(100):
     print(number)
     time.sleep(.1)</code></pre>
    <p><strong>while Loop</strong></p>
    <p>
      The while loop runs the code while something stays true. You would put
      <code>while &lt;expression&gt;</code>. Every time the loop runs, it
      evaluates if the expression is True. It it is, it runs the code, if not it
      continues outside of the loop. For example:
    </p>
    <p><em>while.py</em></p>
    <pre class="text"><code>while True: # Runs forever
     print(&#39;Hello World!&#39;)</code></pre>
    <p>Or you could do:</p>
    <p><em>while2.py</em></p>
    <pre class="text"><code>import random
position = &#39;&lt;placeholder&gt;&#39;
while position != 1: # will run at least once
    position = random.randint(1, 10)
    print(position)</code></pre>
    <p>
      The if statement allows you to check if something is True. If so, it runs
      the code, if not, it continues on. It is kind of like a while loop, but it
      executes <strong>only once</strong>. An if statement is written:
    </p>
    <p><em>if.py</em></p>
    <pre class="text"><code>import random
num = random.randint(1, 10)
if num == 3:
     print(&#39;num is 3. Hooray!!!&#39;)
if num &gt; 5:
     print(&#39;Num is greater than 5&#39;)
if num == 12:
     print(&#39;Num is 12, which means that there is a problem with the python language, see if you can figure it out. Extra credit if you can figure it out!&#39;)</code></pre>
    <p>
      Now, you may think that it would be better if you could make it print only
      one message. Not as many that are True. You can do that with an
      <code>elif</code> statement:
    </p>
    <p><em>elif.py</em></p>
    <pre class="text"><code>import random
num = random.randint(1, 10)
if num == 3:
    print(&#39;Num is three, this is the only msg you will see.&#39;)
elif num &gt; 2:
    print(&#39;Num is not three, but is greater than 1&#39;)</code></pre>
    <p>
      Now, you may wonder how to run code if none work. Well, there is a simple
      statement called <code>else:</code>
    </p>
    <p><em>else.py</em></p>
    <pre class="text"><code>import random
num = random.randint(1, 10)
if num == 3:
    print(&#39;Num is three, this is the only msg you will see.&#39;)
elif num &gt; 2:
    print(&#39;Num is not three, but is greater than 1&#39;)
else:
    print(&#39;No category&#39;)</code></pre>
    <p>
      So far, you have only seen how to use functions other people have made.
      Let use the example that you want to print the a random number between 1
      and 9, and print different text every time.<br />
      It is quite tiring to type:
    </p>
    <p>Characters: 389</p>
    <p><em>nofunc.py</em></p>
    <pre class="text"><code>import random
print(random.randint(1, 9))
print(&#39;Wow that was interesting.&#39;)
print(random.randint(1, 9))
print(&#39;Look at the number above ^&#39;)
print(random.randint(1, 9))
print(&#39;All of these have been interesting numbers.&#39;)
print(random.randint(1, 9))
print(&quot;these random.randint&#39;s are getting annoying to type&quot;)
print(random.randint(1, 9))
print(&#39;Hi&#39;)
print(random.randint(1, 9))
print(&#39;j&#39;)</code></pre>
    <p>Now with functions, you can seriously lower the amount of characters:</p>
    <p>Characters: 254</p>
    <p><em>functions.py</em></p>
    <pre class="text"><code>import random
def r(t):
     print(random.randint(1, 9))
     print(t)
r(&#39;Wow that was interesting.&#39;)
r(&#39;Look at the number above ^&#39;)
r(&#39;All of these have been interesting numbers.&#39;)
r(&quot;these random.randint&#39;s are getting annoying to type&quot;)
r(&#39;Hi&#39;)
r(&#39;j&#39;)</code></pre>

      Most programmers find programming a lot of fun, and besides, it also gets
      their work done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Programming mainly involves <em>problem solving</em>, where one makes use
      of a computer to solve a real world problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      During our journey here, we will approach programming in a very different
      way. We will not only introduce you to the Python language, but also help
      you pick up essential problem solving skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a programmer, you need to be able to look at a problem, and identify
      the important programming concepts relevant to solving it. Finally, you
      need to be able to use the language features and syntax, to express your
      solution on the computer. While all this looks complex, we want to make it
      easy for you. Together, we will tackle a variety of programming
      challenges, using these same steps. We will start with simple challenges
      (such as a Multiplication Table), and gradually increase the difficulty
      level over the duration of this book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Learning to program is a lot like learning to ride a bicycle. The first
      few steps are the most challenging ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you get over these initial steps, your experience will become more
      and more enjoyable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Are you ready for your first programming challenge? Let’s get going now!
      We wish you all the best.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>In this step, we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Were introduced to the concept of problem solving</li>
      <li>Understood how good programmers approach problem solving</li>

      Step 01: Our First Programming Challenge
    </h4>
    <p>
      Our first <em>programming challenge</em> aims to do, what every kid does
      in math class: read out a multiplication table. We now want to give this
      task to the computer. Here is the statement of our problem:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The Print Multiplication Table Challenge (PMT-Challenge)</strong>
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Compute the multiplication table for <code>5</code>, with entries from
        <code>1</code> to <code>10</code>.
      </li>
      <li>Display this table.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The display needs to be:</p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>5 * 1 = 5</strong></em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>5 * 2 = 10</strong></em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>5 * 3 = 15</strong></em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>5 * 4 = 20</strong></em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>5 * 5 = 25</strong></em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>5 * 6 = 30</strong></em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>5 * 7 = 35</strong></em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>5 * 8 = 40</strong></em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>5 * 9 = 45</strong></em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>5 * 10 = 50</strong></em>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the challenge. For convenience, let’s give it a label, say
      <em>PMT-Challenge</em>. What would be the important concepts we need to
      learn, to solve this challenge? The following list of concepts would be a
      good starting point:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Statements</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Expressions</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Variables</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Literals</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Conditionals</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Loops</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Methods</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In the rest of this chapter, we will introduce these concepts to you,
      one-by-one. We will also show you how learning each concept, takes us
      closer to a solution to <em>PMT-Challenge</em>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>In this step, we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stated our first programming challenge</li>
      <li>
        Identified what programming concepts we need to learn, to solve this
        challenge

      Step 02: Breaking Down <em>PMT-Challenge</em>
    </h4>
    <p>
      Typically when we do programming, we have problems. Solving the problem
      typically need a step-by -step approach. Common sense tells us that to
      solve a complex problem, we break it into smaller parts, and solve each
      part one by one. Here is how any good programmer worth her salt, would
      solve a problem:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Simplify the problem, by breaking it into sub-problems</li>
      <li>
        Solve the sub-problems in stages (in some order), using the language
      </li>
      <li>Combine these solutions to get a final solution</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The <em>PMT-Challenge</em> is no different! Now how do we break it down,
      and where do we really start? Once again, your common sense will reveal a
      solution. As a first step, we could get the computer to calculate say,
      <code>5 * 3</code>. The second thing we can do, is to try and print the
      calculated value, in a manner similar to <code>5 * 3 = 15</code>. Then, we
      could repeat what we just did, to print out all the entries of the
      <code>5</code> multiplication table. Let’s put it down a little more
      formally:
    </p>
    <p>Here is how our draft steps look like</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Calculate <code>5 * 3</code> and print result as <code>15</code></li>
      <li>
        Print <code>5 * 3 = 15</code> (<code>15</code> is result of previous
        calculation)
      </li>
      <li>
        Do this ten times, once for each table entry (going from
        <code>1</code> to <code>10</code>)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let’s start with that kind of a game plan, and see where it takes us.</p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>In this step, we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Learned that breaking down a problem into sub-problems is a great help
      </li>
      <li>Found a way to break down the <em>PMT-Challenge</em> problem</li>
    </ul>

      Step 03: Introducing Operators And Expressions
    </h4>
    <p>
      Let’s focus on solving the first sub-problem of <em>PMT-Challenge</em>,
      the numeric computation. We want the computer to calculate
      <code>5 * 5</code> for example, and print <code>25</code> for us. How do
      we get it to do that? That’s what we would be looking at in this step.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Snippet-01: Introducing Operators</strong></p>
    <p>
      Launch up Python shell. We want to calculate <code>5 * 5</code>. How do we
      do that?
    </p>
    <p>Using our knowledge of school math, let’s try <code>5 X 5</code>.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; 5 X 5
    File &quot;&lt; stdin &gt;&quot;, line 1
    5 X 5
      ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax</code></pre>
    <p>
      The Python Shell hits back at us, saying “<em>invalid syntax</em>”. This
      is how Python complains, when it doesn’t fully understand the code you
      type in. Here, it says our code has a “<strong>SyntaxError</strong>”.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason why it complains, is because ‘<code>X</code>’ is not a valid
      <strong>operator</strong> in Python.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way you can do multiplication is by using the ‘<code>*</code>’
      <em>operator</em> .
    </p>
    <p>
      “<em>5 into 5</em>” is achieved by the code <code>5 * 5</code>, and you
      can see the result <code>25</code> being printed. Similarly,
      <code>5 * 6</code> gives us <code>30</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; 5 * 6
    30</code></pre>
    <p>There are a wide range of other operators in Python:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>5 + 6</code> gives a result of <code>11</code>.</li>
      <li>
        <p><code>5 - 6</code> leads to <code>-1</code>.</p>
        <pre class="text"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 5 + 6
11
&gt;&gt;&gt; 5 - 6
-1</code></pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <code>10 / 2</code>, gives an output of <code>5.0</code> . There is one
      interesting operator, <code>**</code>. Let’s try <code>10 ** 3</code>. We
      ran this code, and the result we get is <code>1000</code>. Yes you guessed
      right, the operator performs “to the power of”. “<code>10</code> to the
      power of <code>3</code>” is <code>10 * 10 * 10</code>, or
      <code>1000</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; 10 / 2
    5.0
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 10 ** 3
    1000</code></pre>
    <p>
      Another interesting operator is <code>%</code>, called “<em>modulo</em>”,
      which computes the remainder on integer division. If we do
      <code>10 % 3</code>, what is the remainder when <code>10</code> is divided
      by <code>3</code>? <code>3 * 3</code> is <code>9</code>, and
      <code>10 - 9</code> is <code>1</code>, which is what
      <code>%</code> returns in this case.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s look at some terminology:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Whatever pieces of code we gave Python shell to run, are called
        <strong>expressions</strong>. So, <code>5 * 5</code>,
        <code>5 * 6</code> and <code>5 - 6</code> are all <em>expressions</em>.
        An expression is composed of <em>operators</em> and
        <strong>operands</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the expression <code>5 * 6</code>, the two values <code>5</code> and
        <code>6</code> are called operands, and the <code>*</code> operator
        <em>operates</em> on them.
      </li>
      <li>
        The values <code>5</code> and <code>6</code> are
        <strong>literals</strong>, because those are constants which cannot be
        changed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The cool thing about Python, is that you can even have expressions with
      multiple operators. Therefore, you can form an expression with
      <code>5 + 5 + 5</code>, which evaluates to <code>15</code>. This is an
      expression which has three operands, and two <code>+</code> operators. You
      can even have expressions with different types of operators, such as in
      <code>5 + 5 * 5</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; 5 + 5 + 5
    15
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 5 + 5 * 5
    30</code></pre>
    <p>
      Try and play around with the expressions, and understand the output which
      results.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>In this step, we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learned how to give code input to the Python Shell</li>
      <li>Understood that Python has a predefined set of operators</li>
      <li>
        Used a few types of basic operators and their operands, to form

    <h4 id="step-05-puzzles-on-expressions">Step 05: Puzzles On Expressions</h4>
    <p>
      Let’s look at a few puzzles related to expressions, in this step. Before
      that, let’s revise some of the terminology we had learned earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>5 + 6 + 10</code> is an example of an expression. In this
      expression, <code>5</code>, <code>6</code> and <code>10</code> are
      operands. The <code>+</code> here is the operator. You can have multiple
      operators in an expression. We also did mention that the operands, namely
      <code>10</code>, <code>6</code> and <code>5</code>, are literals. Their
      values will not change.
    </p>
    <p>Here are a few puzzles coming up, to explore aspects of expressions.</p>
    <p><strong>Snippet-01: Puzzles On Expressions</strong></p>
    <p>
      Think about what would happen when you do something of this kind:
      <code>5 $ 2</code>. You’re right, it would throw a
      <code>SyntaxError</code>. When Python does not understand the code you
      type in, it reports an error. Here, the expression we’re typing is
      <code>5 $ 2</code>, which does not make sense to Python, hence the
      <code>SyntaxError</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; 5 $ 2
    File &quot;&lt; stdin &gt;&quot;, line 1
    5 $ 2
    ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 5$2
    File &quot;&lt; stdin &gt;&quot;, line 1
    5 $ 2
    ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax</code></pre>
    <p>
      Let’s say we type in <code>5+6+10</code>, without any spaces between the
      operands, and the operators. What do you think will happen? Surprisingly,
      the Python Shell does calculate the value!
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; 5+6+10
    21</code></pre>
    <p>
      In an expression, using spaces makes it easier for you to read it, but
      it’s not mandatory. <code>5 + 6 + 10</code> is easier to read than
      <code>5+6+10</code>, but does not make any difference to the Python
      compiler.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next puzzle tries to evaluate <code>5 / 2</code>, which is “<code
        >5</code
      >
      divided by <code>2</code>”. What would be the output? <code>2.5</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; 5/2
    2.5</code></pre>
    <p>
      If you’re coming from other programming languages like Java or C, this
      might be a surprising result. If you try this in Java for instance, you
      would get <code>2</code> as the output. Note that even though both
      operands are integers, the result of the <code>/</code> operation is a
      floating point value, <code>2.5</code> . Python does what is expected by a
      programmer!
    </p>
    <p>
      The puzzle after that tries to play with <code>5 + 5 * 6</code>. What
      would be the result of this expression? Will it be <code>5 + 5</code> or
      <code>10</code>, then <code>10 * 6</code>, which is <code>60</code>? Or,
      will it be <code>5</code> plus <code>5 * 6</code>, which is
      <code>5</code> + <code>30</code>, that’s <code>35</code>?
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; 5 + 5 * 6
    35</code></pre>
    <p>The correct result is <code>35</code>.</p>
    <p>
      Python decides this is based on the <strong>precedence</strong> of
      operators.
    </p>
    <p>Operators in Python are divided into two sets as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>**</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code> and <code>%</code> have
        higher precedence, or priority.
      </li>
      <li><code>+</code> and <code>-</code> have a lower precedence.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Sub-expressions involving operators from {<code>*</code>, <code>/</code>,
      <code>%</code>, <code>**</code>} are evaluated before those involving
      operators from {<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>}
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s try another small puzzle on precedence, with <code>5 - 2 * 2</code>.
      What would be the result of this? Will it be <code>6</code>, or
      <code>1</code>? It’s <code>1</code>, because <code>*</code> has a higher
      precedence than <code>-</code>. Thus <code>2 * 2</code> is <code>4</code>,
      and <code>5 - 4</code> gives us <code>1</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; 5 - 2 * 2
    1</code></pre>
    <p>
      Let’s say we want to execute <code>5 - 2</code>, to give an output of
      <code>2</code>. How do we change the operator precedence?
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot really change the precedence, but you can add parentheses to
      group sub-expressions differently.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; (5 - 2) * 2
    6
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 5 - ( 2 * 2 )
    1</code></pre>
    <p>
      Parentheses have the highest precedence in Python, and can be used to
      override operator precedence. <code>(5 - 2)</code> gets calculated first,
      and the final result of the expression is <code>6</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A positive thing about using parentheses is, that it makes expressions
      more readable. So even in situations such as <code>5 - 2 * 2</code>, where
      we know the result according to precedence, adding parentheses is good.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>
      In this step, we went about solving a few puzzles about expressions,
      touching concepts such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>SyntaxError</code> for incorrect operators</li>
      <li>White-space in expressions</li>
      <li>Floating Point division by default</li>
      <li>Operator Precedence</li>
      <li>Using parentheses</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="step-06-printing-text">Step 06: Printing Text</h4>
    <p>
      In the previous step, we learned how to use expressions to compute values.
      In this step, let’s see how we can actually print multiplication table
      entries, that are readable by the user.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Snippet-01: Printing Text</strong></p>
    <p>
      How do we go about printing a complete multiplication table entry? We want
      to print text such as <code>5 * 6 = 30</code> . But trying to do so, as we
      know it, gives us a <code>SyntaxError</code>. Clearly, there is a
      different way to print text, as compared to an expression.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; 5 * 6 = 30
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1
    SyntaxError: can&#39;t assign to operator</code></pre>
    <p>
      Let’s first try to print a simple piece of text, <code>Hello</code>.
      Typing in this piece of code directly on Python Shell also gives us an
      error.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; Hello
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    NameError: name &#39;Hello&#39; is not defined</code></pre>
    <p>
      Only expressions work that way, and <code>Hello</code> is not really an
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>"Hello"</code> is typically called a <strong>string</strong>, and
      represents the text of letters <code>'H'</code>, <code>'e'</code>,
      <code>'l'</code>, <code>'l'</code>, <code>'o'</code>.
      <code>"Hello"</code> is hence different from the number <code>5</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a number of in-built functions in Python to help print strings.
      One of these is the <code>print()</code> function. Can you just say
      <code>print Hello</code>?
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print Hello
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1
        print Hello
                  ^
    SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to &#39;print&#39;. Did you mean print(Hello)?</code></pre>
    <p>
      The Python compiler gives you an error, that says “missing parentheses”.
    </p>
    <p>Will <code>print(Hello)</code> work?</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print (Hello)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    NameError: name &#39;Hello&#39; is not defined</code></pre>
    <p>
      Nope! Again, this one failed because you need to indicate that
      <code>"Hello"</code> is a string.
    </p>
    <p>
      How do I indicate that <code>"Hello"</code> is a string? By putting it
      within double quotes.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s try <code>print ("Hello")</code></p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print (&quot;Hello&quot;)
    Hello
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Hello&quot;)
    Hello</code></pre>
    <p>
      <code>print("Hello")</code> finally results in <code>"Hello"</code> being
      printed out. To be able to print <code>"Hello"</code>, the things we need
      to do are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Typing the method name print ,</li>
      <li>open parentheses ( ,</li>
      <li>Followed by a double quote " ,</li>
      <li>The text Hello,</li>
      <li>and another double quote " ,</li>
      <li>finished off with a closed parentheses ).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      What we have written here is called a <strong>statement</strong>, a simple
      piece of code to execute. As part of this statement, we are
      <strong>calling</strong> a <strong>function</strong>, named
      <code>print()</code>.
    </p>
    <p>What exactly are we trying to print?</p>
    <p>
      The text <code>"Hello"</code>, which is called a
      <strong>parameter</strong> or <strong>argument</strong>, to
      <code>print()</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let’s get back to what we wanted to do, which is to print
      <code>5 * 6 = 30</code>. The most basic version would be something of this
      kind, <code>print("5 * 6 = 30")</code>. Here, we are passing the entire
      value in the form of a string.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;5 * 6 = 30&quot;)
    5 * 6 = 30</code></pre>
    <p>
      This prints the text on the console, as-is. The thing you need to
      understand here is, we aren’t really calculating <code>30</code> using the
      formula <code>5 * 6</code>, but directly putting text <code>30</code> in
      here. That’s called <strong>hard-coding</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a later step, we will look at how to actually calculate the value and
      pass it in.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>In this step, we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Understood that displaying text on the console is not the same as
        printing an expression value
      </li>
      <li>
        Learned about the <code>print()</code> function, that is used to print
        text in Python.
      </li>
      <li>
        Found a way to print the text <code>"5 * 6 = 30"</code> on the console,
        by hard-coding values in a string

    </ul>

      Step 07: Puzzles On Utility Methods, And Strings
    </h4>
    <p>
      In the previous step, we learned how to print <code>5 * 6 = 30</code>. It
      was not a perfect solution, because we hard-coded everything. we used an
      in-built function named <code>print()</code>, passed a string to it, and
      invoked the method.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this step, let’s look at a number of puzzles related to in-built
      methods, their parameters, and strings in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, let’s do <code>print("5 * 6")</code>, as in the previous
      step. What does this code result in?
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;5*6&quot;)
    5*6
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&#39;5*6&#39;)
    5*6</code></pre>
    <p>It just prints the string <code>"5 * 6"</code>.</p>
    <p>Let’s say we try the code <code>print(5 * 6)</code>,</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(5*6)
    30</code></pre>
    <p>
      Without the double quotes, <code>5 * 6</code> is an expression. What will
      be the output? <code>30</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you call <code>print()</code> with an expression argument, it prints
      the value of the expression. However, when we pass something within double
      quotes, it becomes a piece of text, printed as-is.
    </p>
    <p>
      An interesting thing to note is, that in Python you can use either
      double-quotes (<code>"</code> and <code>"</code>), or single-quotes (<code
        >'</code
      >
      and <code>'</code>) with text values.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s look at a few other in-built methods within Python.</p>
    <p>
      Consider <code>abs()</code> (which stands for absolute value), a method
      that accepts a numeric value. You can use <code>abs(10.5)</code>, passing
      <code>10.5</code> as a value to it, and it prints the absolute value of
      <code>10</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; abs 10.5
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1
        abs 10.5
               ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    &gt;&gt;&gt; abs(10.5)
    10.5</code></pre>
    <p>
      If you pass in a string value, will it work? It complains, “<code
        >abs()</code
      >
      function will not work with a string, it only works with numeric values”.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; abs(&quot;10.5&quot;)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    TypeError: bad operand type for abs(): &#39;str&#39;</code></pre>
    <p>
      Let’s say you want to use a function that computes “to the power of”, for
      instance “<code>2</code> to the power of <code>5</code>”. In Python,
      there’s an in-built function named <code>pow()</code>, which does just
      what we need. To <code>pow()</code>, you can pass two parameters and
      calculate the result. How do you do that?
    </p>
    <p>
      Will this work: <code>pow 2 5</code>? No, not at all. This code does not
      work as well: <code>pow(2 5)</code>. <code>pow(2, 5)</code> is the correct
      syntax.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; pow 2 5
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1
        pow 2 5
            ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    &gt;&gt;&gt; pow(2 5)
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1
        pow(2 5)
              ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    &gt;&gt;&gt; pow(2, 5)
    32</code></pre>
    <p>You’ll see that <code>32</code> is printed.</p>
    <p>
      Let’s see another example, “<code>10</code> to the power of
      <code>3</code>”. <code>pow(10,3)</code> is the alternative to saying
      <code>10 ** 3</code>. This gives us <code>1000</code>, similar to how
      <code>pow()</code> would.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; pow(10, 3)
    1000
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 10 ** 3
    1000</code></pre>
    <p>
      <code>max()</code> returns maximum in a set of numbers.<code>min()</code>
      function returns the minimum value.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; max(34, 45, 67)
    67
    &gt;&gt;&gt; min(34, 45, 67)
    34</code></pre>
    <p>
      These are some of the in-built functions in Python, and we saw how to call
      the in-built functions by passing in a varied number of parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Python is case sensitive. So let’s say I want of calculate
      <code>pow(2,5)</code>. So this would give me <code>32</code>. Now, what if
      I say capital <code>'P'</code> instead of small <code>'p'</code> here?
      <code>Pow(2,5)</code> would lead to an error.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; pow(2,5)
    32
    &gt;&gt;&gt; Pow(2,5)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    NameError: name &#39;Pow&#39; is not defined</code></pre>
    <p>
      The only things not case-sensitive in Python, are string values. Earlier
      we saw that the code <code>print("Hello")</code> displays the text
      <code>"Hello"</code>. Inside a string, the text can be in any case. Hence,
      <code>print("hello")</code> displays <code>"hello"</code> ,with a small
      <code>'h'</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Hello&quot;)
    Hello
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;hello&quot;)
    hello
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;hellO&quot;)
    hellO
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print ( &quot;hellO&quot; )
    hellO</code></pre>
    <p>
      However inside your code, you need to be very particular about the case of
      function names, class names, variable names, and the like.
    </p>
    <p>
      In your code, whitespace does not really matter. You can add space here
      and here, and you would still get the same output. However, in case of
      strings, whitespace does matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we say <code>print("hellO World")</code>, it would print
      <code>"hellO World"</code>, with a space in between. And if you do
      <code>print("hellO World")</code> with three spaces, it would print the
      same. In expressions, white-space does not affect the output.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print ( &quot;hellO World&quot; )
    hellO World
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print ( &quot;hellO     World&quot; )
    hellO     World</code></pre>
    <p>
      The last thing we want to look at, is an <strong>escape sequence</strong>.
      Let’s say you want to print a double quote, <code>"</code>, in the code.
      If we were to do this: <code>print("Hello"")</code>, what would happen?
      The compiler says error!
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Hello&quot;&quot;)
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1
        print(&quot;Hello&quot;&quot;)
                      ^
    SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal</code></pre>
    <p>
      If you want to print a <code>"</code> inside a string, use an escape
      sequence. In Python, the symbol <code>'\'</code> is used as an
      <strong>escape character</strong>. On using <code>'\'</code> adjacent to
      the <code>"</code>, it prints <code>Hello"</code> (notice the trailing
      <code>"</code>). We have used the <code>'\'</code> to
      <strong>escape</strong> the <code>"</code>, by forming an
      <em>escape sequence</em> <code>\"</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Hello\&quot;&quot;)
Hello&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
      The other reason why you would want to use a <code>'\'</code> is to print
      a <code>&lt;NEWLINE&gt;</code>. If you want to print
      <code>"Hello World"</code>, but with <code>"Hello"</code> on one line and
      <code>"World"</code> on the next, <code>'\n'</code> is the escape sequence
      to use.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Hello\nWorld&quot;)
    Hello
    World</code></pre>
    <p>
      The other important escape sequence is <code>'\t'</code>, which prints a
      <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code> in the output. When you do
      <code>print("Hello\tWorld")</code>, you can see the tab-space between
      <code>"Hello"</code> and <code>"World"</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Hello\tWorld&quot;)
    Hello   World</code></pre>
    <p>
      Another useful escape sequence is <code>\\</code> . If you want to print a
      <code>\</code> , then use the sequence <code>\\</code> . You would see
      that it prints <code>Hello\World</code> . Think about what would happen if
      we put six <code>\</code> . Yes you’re right! It would print this string:
      <code>"\\\"</code> .
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Hello\\World&quot;)
    Hello\World
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Hello\\\\\\World&quot;)
    Hello\\\World</code></pre>
    <p>
      One of the things with Python is, it does not matter whether you use
      double quotes or single quotes to enclose strings. There are some
      interesting, and useful ways of using a combination of both, within the
      same string. Have a look at this call: <code>print("Hello'World")</code>,
      and notice the output we get. In a similar way, the following code will be
      accepted and run by the Python system: <code>print('Hello"World')</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&#39;Hello&quot;&#39;)
    Hello&quot;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Hello&#39;World&quot;)
    Hello&#39;World
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Hello\&quot;World&quot;)
    Hello&quot;World
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Hello\&quot;World&quot;)
    Hello&quot;World</code></pre>
    <p>
      The above two examples can be used as a tip by newbie programmers when
      they form string literals, and want to use them in their code:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If the string literal contains one or more single quotes, then you can
        use double quotes to enclose it.
      </li>
      <li>
        However if the string contains one or more double quotes, then prefer to
        use single quotes to enclose it.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

      Step 08: Formatted Output With print()
    </h4>
    <p>
      In the previous step, we learned how to print a hard-coded string, such as
      <code>"5 * 6 = 30"</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this step, let’s try to replace the hard-coded <code>30</code> with a
      computed value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s start with a simple scenario. Let’s say we want to place that
      calculated value within a string, and display it. How do we do that?
    </p>
    <p><strong>Snippet-01: print() Formatted Output</strong></p>
    <p><code>format()</code> method can be used to print formatted text.</p>
    <p>Let’s see an example:</p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;VALUE&quot;.format(5*2))
    VALUE</code></pre>
    <p>
      We were expecting <code>10</code> to be printed, but it’s actually
      printing <code>VALUE</code>.
    </p>
    <p>How do we get <code>10</code> to be printed then?</p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;VALUE {0}&quot;.format(5*2))
    VALUE 10</code></pre>
    <p>
      By having an open brace <code>{</code>, closed brace <code>}</code>, and
      and by putting the index of the value between them. Here, the value is the
      first parameter, and it’s index will be <code>0</code>.
    </p>
    <p><code>"VALUE {0}"</code> is what we need.</p>
    <p>
      Let’s take another example. Suppose to the <code>format()</code> function,
      we pass three values: <code>10</code>, <code>20</code> and
      <code>30</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically when we count positions or indexes, we start from
      <code>0</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To print the first value, you need to pass in an index of <code>0</code>.
      To print the second value, pass an index of <code>1</code>.
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;VALUE {0}&quot;.format(10,20,30))
    VALUE 10
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;VALUE {1}&quot;.format(10,20,30))
    VALUE 20
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;VALUE {2}&quot;.format(10,20,30))
    VALUE 30</code></pre>
    <p>
      Now going back to our problem, we wanted to display
      <code>"5 * 6 = 30"</code>, but without hard-coding. Instead of
      <code>30</code>, we want the calculated value of <code>5 * 6</code>.
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;5 * 6 = 30&quot;.format(5,6,5*6))
    5 * 6 = 30</code></pre>
    <p>
      Let replace <code>"5 * 6 = 30"</code> with <code>"5 * 6 = {2}"</code>.
      <code>2</code> is the index of parameter value <code>5*6</code>.
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;5 * 6 = {2}&quot;.format(5,6,5*6))
    5 * 6 = 30</code></pre>
    <p>Cool! Progress made.</p>
    <p>
      Let’s replace <code>5 * 6</code> with the right indices -
      <code>{0} * {1}</code>.
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;{0} * {1} = {2}&quot;.format(5,6,5*6))
    5 * 6 = 30</code></pre>
    <p>
      The great thing about this, is now we can replace the values we passed to
      <code>print()</code> in the first place, without changing the indexes! So,
      we can display results for <code>5 * 7 = 35</code> and
      <code>5 * 8 = 40</code>. We are now able to print <code>5 * 6 = 30</code>,
      <code>5 * 7 = 35</code>, <code>5 * 8 = 40</code>, and can do similar
      things for other table entries as well.
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;{0} * {1} = {2}&quot;.format(5,7,5*7))
    5 * 7 = 35
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;{0} * {1} = {2}&quot;.format(5,8,5*8))
    5 * 8 = 40
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;{0} * {1} = {2}&quot;.format(5,8,5*8))
    5 * 8 = 40</code></pre>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>In this step, we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Discovered that Python provides a way to do formatted printing of string
        values
      </li>
      <li>
        Looked at the <code>format()</code> function, and saw how to call it
        within <code>print()</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Observed how we could work only with the indexes of parameters to
        <code>format()</code>, and change the parameters we pass without
        changing the code
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="step-09-puzzles-on-format-and-print">
      Step 09: Puzzles On format() and print()
    </h4>
    <p>
      In this step, let’s look at a few puzzles related to the format, and the
      print methods.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Snippet-01: format() And print() Puzzles</strong></p>
    <p>
      Let’s say we pass in additional values, such as: <code>5 * 8</code>,
      <code>5 * 9</code> and <code>5 * 10</code>. However, within the call to
      <code>format()</code>, we are only referring to the values at index
      <code>0</code>, index <code>1</code> and index <code>2</code>. The values
      at indexes <code>3</code> and <code>4</code> are not used at all. What
      would happen when we run the code?
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;{0} * {1} = {2}&quot;.format(5,8,5*8,5*9,5*10))
    5 * 8 = 40</code></pre>
    <p>
      Would this throw an error? No, it does not. You can see that the
      additional values which are passed in, are conveniently ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s say instead of passing in a value of <code>2</code>, we pass
      <code>4</code>. What would happen?
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;{0} * {1} = {4}&quot;.format(5,8,5*8,5*9,5*10))
    5 * 8 = 50</code></pre>
    <p><code>5 * 10</code> is the value at index <code>4</code></p>
    <p>
      Now let’s take a different scenario. We remove all the parameters passed
      to <code>format()</code>. However, inside the call to
      <code>print()</code>, we continue to say <code>{0} * {1} = {4}</code>. So
      we are trying to print the value at index <code>4</code>, but are only
      passing two values to the function <code>format()</code>. What do you
      think will happen?
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;{0} * {1} = {4}&quot;.format(5,8))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    IndexError: tuple index out of range</code></pre>
    <p>
      It says <code>IndexError</code>, which means :“you are asking me to fetch
      the value at index <code>4</code>, but only passing in two values. How can
      I do what you want?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s look at a few more things related to other data types. We try to
      format the following inside <code>print()</code>:
      <code>{0} * {1} = {2}</code>, and would pass in <code>2.5</code>,
      <code>2</code>, and <code>2.5 * 2</code> . Here, <code>2</code> is an
      integer value, but <code>2.5</code> is a floating point value. You can see
      that it prints <code>2.5 * 2 = 5.0</code>. So this approach of formatting
      values with <code>print()</code>, works also with floating point data as
      well.
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;{0} * {1} = {2}&quot;.format(2.5,2,2.5*2))
    2.5 * 2 = 5.0</code></pre>
    <p>
      Now, are there are other types of data that <code>format()</code> works
      with? Yes, strings can join the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s say over here, we do:
      <code>print("My name is {0}".format("Ranga"))</code>. What would happen?
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;My name is {0}&quot;.format(&quot;Ranga&quot;))
    My name is Ranga</code></pre>
    <p>
      Index <code>0</code> will be replaced with the first parameter to
      <code>format()</code>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>In this step, we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Understood the behavior when the parameters passed to
        <code>format()</code>:
        <ul>
          <li>Exceed the indexes accessed by <code>print()</code></li>
          <li>Are less than the indexes accessed by <code>print()</code></li>
          <li>Are of type integer, floating-point or string</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="step-10-introducing-variables">Step 10: Introducing Variables</h4>
    <p>
      We are slowly making progress toward our main goal, which is to print the
      <code>5</code> multiplication table.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first statement, we are printing <code>5 * 1 = 5</code>, and then
      changing the literals. To make it print <code>5 * 2 = 10</code>, we are
      changing <code>1</code> to <code>2</code>. Next, we are changing
      <code>2</code> to <code>3</code>. How do we make it a little simpler, so
      that our effort is reduced?
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;{0} * {1} = {2}&quot;.format(5,1,5*1))
    5 * 1 = 5
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;{0} * {1} = {2}&quot;.format(5,2,5*2))
    5 * 2 = 10
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;{0} * {1} = {2}&quot;.format(5,3,5*3))
    5 * 3 = 15</code></pre>
    <p>Let’s try a different approach.</p>
    <p>
      What would happen if you replace <code>1</code> with <code>index</code>,
      and <code>5 * 1</code> with <code>5 * index</code>, and try to run it?
    </p>
    <p>It gives an error! It says: “index is not defined”.</p>
    <p>
      Let’s try and fix this, and execute <code>index = 2</code>. What would
      happen?
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; index = 2</code></pre>
    <p>Aha! This compiles.</p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;{0} * {1} = {2}&quot;.format(5,index,5*index))
    5 * 2 = 10</code></pre>
    <p>And this statement is printing <code>5 * 2 = 10</code>.</p>
    <p>
      Let’s try something else. Let’s make <code>index = 3</code>. What would
      happen?
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; index = 3
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;{0} * {1} = {2}&quot;.format(5,index,5*index))
    5 * 3 = 15</code></pre>
    <p>The same statement on being run, prints <code>5 * 3 = 15</code>.</p>
    <p>
      How can you check the value that <code>index</code> has? Just type in
      <code>index</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; index
    3
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;{0} * {1} = {2}&quot;.format(5,index,5*index))
    5 * 3 = 15</code></pre>
    <p>
      The <code>index</code> symbol we have used here, is what is called a
      <strong>variable</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>In Python, it’s also called a <strong>name</strong>.</p>
    <p>
      You can see that the value <code>index</code> referring to, can change
      over the duration of a program.
    </p>
    <p>
      Initially, <code>index</code> was referring to a value of <code>1</code>.
      later, <code>index</code> was referring to a value of <code>3</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, think about how you would print the entire table. All that you need
      to do, is start from <code>1</code>, execute the same statement with
      <code>print()</code> and <code>format()</code>, to get output
      <code>5 * 1 = 5</code>. Next, Change the value of index to <code>2</code>,
      and then print the same statement. Next, <code>index = 3</code>, and print
      the same statement again.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; index = 1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;{0} * {1} = {2}&quot;.format(5,index,5*index))
    5 * 1 = 5
    &gt;&gt;&gt; index = 2
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;{0} * {1} = {2}&quot;.format(5,index,5*index))
    5 * 2 = 10
    &gt;&gt;&gt; index = 3
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;{0} * {1} = {2}&quot;.format(5,index,5*index))
    5 * 3 = 15</code></pre>
    <p>
      With the same statement
      <code>print("{0} * {1} = {2}".format(5,index,5*index))</code>, we are able
      to print different values. The value of <code>index</code> varies, but the
      code remains the same!
    </p>
    <p>
      Variables make the program much more easier to read, as well as more
      generic.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Snippet-02: Classroom Exercise On Variables</strong></p>
    <p>Let’s do a simple exercise with variables.</p>
    <p>
      We want to create three variables <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and
      <code>c</code>. Let’s initially give them some values, say a value of
      <code>5</code> to <code>a</code>, <code>6</code> to <code>b</code> and
      <code>7</code> to <code>c</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We want to get output of this kind: <code>5 + 6 + 7 = 18</code>, without
      using the literal values.
    </p>
    <p>
      You would want to use the values stored in the variables in
      <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re hard-coding, the way to do it is with
      <code>print("5 + 6 + 7 = 18")</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; a = 5
    &gt;&gt;&gt; b = 6
    &gt;&gt;&gt; c = 7
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;5 + 6 + 7 = 18&quot;)
    5 + 6 + 7 = 18
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;5 + 6 + 7 = 18&quot;.format(a,b,c,a+b+c))
    5 + 6 + 7 = 18</code></pre>
    <p>
      The way you can do that is with code like this:
      <code>print("{0} + {1} + {2} = {3}".format(a,b,c,a+b+c))</code>.
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;{0} + {1} + {2} = {3}&quot;.format(a,b,c,a+b+c))
    5 + 6 + 7 = 18</code></pre>
    <p>How do you confirm we are accessing values stored in the variables?</p>
    <p>
      Let’s change the values of <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and
      <code>c</code>. Let’s make <code>a = 6</code> , <code>b = 7</code> , and
      <code>c = 8</code> . Execute same statement.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; a = 6
    &gt;&gt;&gt; b = 7
    &gt;&gt;&gt; c = 8
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;{0} + {1} + {2} = {3}&quot;.format(a,b,c,a+b+c))
    6 + 7 + 8 = 21</code></pre>
    <p>
      You can see the magic of variables at play here! Based on what values
      these variables are referring to, you can see that the output of the print
      statement changes.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>In this step, we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Were introduced to variables, or names, in Python</li>
      <li>
        Observed how we could pass in values of variables to the
        <code>format()</code> function
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="step-11-puzzles-on-variables">Step 11: Puzzles On Variables</h4>
    <p>
      In the previous step, we were introduced to the concept of variables in
      Python.
    </p>
    <p>We will start with looking at a few puzzles.</p>
    <p><strong>Snippet-01: Puzzles On Variables</strong></p>
    <p>What if I try to refer to a variable which is not yet created?</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; count
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    NameError: name &#39;count&#39; is not defined
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(count)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    NameError: name &#39;count&#39; is not defined</code></pre>
    <p>
      Before using a variable, you need to have it assigned a value. If you have
      not defined a variable before, then you cannot use it. Consider
      <code>print(count)</code>, it does not know what count is. So it would
      throw an error, saying: “<code>count</code> is not defined, I have no idea
      what count is.”
    </p>
    <p>Once you assign a value to a variable, you can use it.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; count = 4
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(count)
    4</code></pre>
    <p>
      The statement <code>count = 4</code> where we are creating a variable
      named <code>count</code> for the first time, is called a
      <strong>variable definition</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the first time you’re referring to a variable, and assigning a
      value to it.
    </p>
    <p>Python will create a variable in its memory.</p>
    <p>
      Variable names are case sensitive. <code>count</code> and
      <code>Count</code> are not the same thing.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; Count
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    NameError: name &#39;Count&#39; is not defined
    &gt;&gt;&gt; count
    4</code></pre>
    <p>There are rules to follow while naming variables.</p>
    <p>
      All variable names should either start with an alphabet , or an underscore
      <code>_</code> . <code>count</code>, <code>_count</code> are valid.
      <code>1count</code> is invalid.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; 1count = 5
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1
        1count = 5
             ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    &gt;&gt;&gt; count = 5
    &gt;&gt;&gt; _count = 5
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 1count
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1
        1count
             ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 2count
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1
        2count
             ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax</code></pre>
    <p>After the first symbol, you can also use a numeral in variable names.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; c12345 = 5</code></pre>
    <p>To summarize the rules for naming variables.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        This should start with an alphabet (a capital or a small alphabet) or
        underscore.
      </li>
      <li>
        Starting the second character, it can be alphabet, or underscore, or a
        numeric value.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>In this step, we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understood that a variable needs to be defined before it is used</li>
      <li>
        Learned that there are certain rules to be followed while giving names
        to variables
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="step-12-introducing-assignment">Step 12: Introducing Assignment</h4>
    <p>
      In this step, we will look at an important concept in Python, called
      <strong>assignment</strong>. In previous steps, we created variables, like
      <code>i = 5</code>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Snippet-01: Introducing Assignment</strong></p>
    <p>
      You can create other variables using whatever value <code>i</code> is
      referring to. If we say <code>j = i</code>, what would happen?
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; i = 5
    &gt;&gt;&gt; j = i
    &gt;&gt;&gt; j
    5</code></pre>
    <p>
      <code>j</code> would start referring to the same value that
      <code>i</code> is referring to. This statement is called an
      <strong>assignment</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s try <code>j = 2 * i</code>.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; j = 2 * i
    &gt;&gt;&gt; j
    10</code></pre>
    <p><code>j</code> refers to a value of <code>10</code></p>
    <p>
      <code>=</code> has a different meaning in programming compared to
      mathematics.
    </p>
    <p>
      In mathematics, When we execute <code>j = i</code>, it means
      <code>j</code> and <code>i</code> are equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      In prgramming, the value of the expression on right hand side is assigned
      to the variable on the right hand side. Can you use a constant on the left
      hand side of an assignment? The answer is “No”!
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; 5 = j
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1
    SyntaxError: can&#39;t assign to literal</code></pre>
    <p>
      The Python Shell throws an error, saying “Can’t assign to literal”, as
      <code>5</code> is a literal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s create a couple of variables. <code>num1 = 5</code> and
      <code>num2 = 3</code>. We would want to add these and create a fresh
      variable. Let’s say the name of the variable is <code>sum</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; num1 = 5
    &gt;&gt;&gt; num2 = 3
    &gt;&gt;&gt; sum = num1 + num2
    &gt;&gt;&gt; sum
    8</code></pre>
    <p>
      Create 3 variables <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> with
      different values and calculate their sum.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; a = 5
    &gt;&gt;&gt; b = 6
    &gt;&gt;&gt; c = 7
    &gt;&gt;&gt; sum = a + b + c
    &gt;&gt;&gt; sum
    18</code></pre>
    <p>We have just seen the mechanics of how assignment works in Python.</p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>In this step, we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Learned what happens when you assign a value to a variable, which may or
        may not exist
      </li>
      <li>
        Discovered that literal constants cannot be placed on the left hand side
        of the assignment(<code>=</code>) operator
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="step-13-introducing-formatted-printing">
      Step 13: Introducing Formatted Printing
    </h4>
    <p>
      Until now, we have been using the <code>format()</code> method to format
      and print values. Let’s see a better approach to printing values.
    </p>
    <p>This is the approach we used until now.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; a = 1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; b = 2
    &gt;&gt;&gt; c = 3
    &gt;&gt;&gt; sum = a + b + c
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;{0} + {1} + {2} = {3}&quot;.format(a, b, c ,sum))
    1 + 2 + 3 = 6</code></pre>
    <p>
      Python has the concept of formatted strings. The syntax to use a formatted
      string is very simple - <code>f""</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we want to print the value of a variable <code>a</code>, we can use
      <code>{a}</code> in the text.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(f&quot;&quot;)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(f&quot;value of a is {a}&quot;)
    value of a is 1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(f&quot;value of b is {b}&quot;)
    value of b is 2</code></pre>
    <p>The variable within braces is replaced by its value.</p>
    <p>
      You can use expressions in a formatted string. Example below uses
      <code>{a+b}</code>.
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(f&quot;sum of a and b is {a + b}&quot;)
    sum of a and b is 3</code></pre>
    <p>This feature was introduced in a Python 3 release.</p>
    <p>
      Let’s get back to the original problem we wanted to solve: printing
      <code>5 + 6 + 7 = 18</code>, using formatted strings.
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(f&quot;{a} + {b} + {c} = {sum}&quot;)
    1 + 2 + 3 = 6</code></pre>
    <p>You can see how easy it turns out to be!</p>
    <h4 id="step-14-the-pmt-challenge-revisited">
      Step 14: The PMT-Challenge Revisited
    </h4>
    <p>
      We want to print the <code>5</code>-table from
      <code>5 * 1 = 5</code> onward, until we reach to <code>5 * 10 = 50</code>.
      The best solution we have right now, is shown below:
    </p>
    <p><strong>Snippet-01:</strong></p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; index = 1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;{0} * {1} = {2}&quot;.format(5,index,5*index))
    5 * 1 = 5
    &gt;&gt;&gt; index = 2
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;{0} * {1} = {2}&quot;.format(5,index,5*index))
    5 * 2 = 10
    &gt;&gt;&gt; index = 3
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;{0} * {1} = {2}&quot;.format(5,index,5*index))
    5 * 3 = 15
    &gt;&gt;&gt; index = 4
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;{0} * {1} = {2}&quot;.format(5,index,5*index))
    5 * 4 = 20</code></pre>
    <p>
      Can we do something, to make sure that the code remains the same all the
      time, but the <code>index</code> value gets updated?
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; index = index + 1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;{0} * {1} = {2}&quot;.format(5,index,5*index))
    5 * 5 = 25
    &gt;&gt;&gt; index = index + 1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;{0} * {1} = {2}&quot;.format(5,index,5*index))
    5 * 6 = 30
    &gt;&gt;&gt; index = index + 1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;{0} * {1} = {2}&quot;.format(5,index,5*index))
    5 * 7 = 35</code></pre>
    <p>
      We used <code>index = index + 1</code> to increment
      <code>index</code> value.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we execute these same two statements again and again, we can print the
      entire table! This is exactly what loops help us do: execute the same
      statements repeatedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simplest loop available in Python is the <strong>for loop</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we run a <code>for</code> loop, we need to specify the range of
      values - <code>1</code> to <code>10</code> or <code>1</code> to
      <code>20</code>, and so on. <code>range()</code> function helps us to
      specify a range of values.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; range(1,10)
    range(1, 10)</code></pre>
    <p>
      The syntax of the <code>for</code> loop is:
      <code>for i in range(1, 10): ...</code>. Here, <code>i</code> is the name
      of the <strong>control variable</strong>. In Python, you need to put a
      colon, ‘<code>:</code>’, and in the next line give indentation.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(1,10):
    ...   print(i)
    ...
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9</code></pre>
    <p>You would see that it prints from <code>1</code> to <code>9</code>.</p>
    <p>
      When we run a loop in <code>range(1, 10)</code>, <code>1</code> is
      <em>inclusive</em> and <code>10</code> is <strong>exclusive</strong>.The
      loop runs from <code>1</code> to the value before <code>10</code>, which
      is <code>9</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The leading whitespace before <code>print(i)</code> is called
      <strong>indentation</strong>. We’ll talk about indentation later, when we
      talk about puzzles related to the <code>for</code> loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      How can you extend this concept to solving our
      <em>PMT-Challenge</em> problem?
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(f&quot;{5} * {index} = {5*index}&quot;)
    5 * 7 = 35</code></pre>
    <p>
      What we were doing earlier, was calling <code>print()</code> with a
      formatted string. Now we want to print this statement for different values
      of <code>i</code>.
    </p>
    <p>How can you do that?</p>
    <p>Let’s start with a simple example.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(1,11):
    ...   print(f&quot;{i}&quot;)
    ...
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9
    10</code></pre>
    <p><code>print(f"{i}")</code> prints the value of i.</p>
    <p>
      Now, how do we get it to print <code>5 * 1 = 5</code> to
      <code>5 * 10 = 50</code>?
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(1,11):
    ...   print(f&quot;5 * {i} = {5 * i}&quot;)
    ...
    5 * 1 = 5
    5 * 2 = 10
    5 * 3 = 15
    5 * 4 = 20
    5 * 5 = 25
    5 * 6 = 30
    5 * 7 = 35
    5 * 8 = 40
    5 * 9 = 45
    5 * 10 = 50
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 5 * 4 * 50
    1000</code></pre>
    <p>
      <code>print(f"5 * {i} = {5 * i}")</code> prints a specific multiple of 5.
    </p>
    <h4 id="step-15-loops">Step 15: Loops</h4>
    <p>
      In a previous step, we took a major step in programming. We wrote our
      first for loop with Python. In this step, let’s try a few puzzles to
      understand the for loop even further.
    </p>
    <p>The syntax of the for loop we looked at earlier was:</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>  for i in range(1, 10):
    print(i)</code></pre>
    <p><strong>Snippet-01:</strong></p>
    <p>
      Let’s say we write a <code>for</code> loop, but don’t give a
      <code>:</code> after the <code>range()</code> method, to close the first
      line. What would happen?
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(1,10)
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1
        for i in range(1,10)
                           ^
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax</code></pre>
    <p>
      Invalid syntax. A <code>:</code> is mandatory within the
      <code>for</code> loop syntax.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s provide a <code>:</code> and in the next line, use
      <code>print(i)</code> without space before it (without indentation).
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(1,10):
    ... print(i)
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 2
        print(i)
            ^
    IndentationError: expected an indented block</code></pre>
    <p>
      Most other programming languages use open brace <code>{</code> and closed
      brace <code>}</code> as delimiters in a <code>for</code> loop. However,
      Python uses indentation to identify which code is part of a
      <code>for</code> loop, and which is not. So if we are writing the body of
      a <code>for</code> loop, we must use indentation, and leave atleast a
      single <code>&lt;SPACE&gt;</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(1,10):
    ...   print(i)
    ...
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9</code></pre>
    <p>
      How do we execute two lines of code as part of the <code>for</code> loop?
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(1,10):
    ...  print(i)
    ...  print(2*i)
    ...
    1
    2
    2
    4
    3
    6

    8
    5
    10
    6
    12
    7
    14
    8
    16
    9
    18</code></pre>
    <p>
      We are indenting both statements with a space - <code>print(i)</code> and
      <code>print(2*i)</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When for loop has only one line of code, you can specify it right after
      the <code>:</code>
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(2,5): print(i)
    ...
    2
    3
    4</code></pre>
    <p>
      However, this is not considered to be a good programming practice. Even
      though you may want to execute just one statement in a
      <code>for</code> loop, indentation on a new line is recommended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another best practice is to use four <code>&lt;SPACE&gt;</code>s for
      indentation, instead of just two. This would give clear indentation of the
      code.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(2,5):
    ...     print(i)
    ...
    2
    3
    4</code></pre>
    <p>
      Anybody who looks at the code immediately understands that this
      <code>print()</code> is part of the <code>for</code> loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s say you only want to print the odd numbers till <code>10</code>,
      which are <code>1</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>5</code>,
      <code>7</code> and <code>9</code>. The <code>range()</code> function
      offers an interesting option.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range (1,11,2):
    ...   print(i)
    ...
    1
    3
    5
    7
    9</code></pre>
    <p>
      In <code>for i in range(1, 11, 2)</code>, we pass in a third argument,
      called a <em>step</em>. After each iteration, the value of
      <code>i</code> is increment by <code>step</code>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>In this step, we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Looked at a few puzzles about the <code>for</code> loop, which lay
        emphasis on the following aspects of for:
        <ul>
          <li>The importance of syntax elements such as the colon</li>
          <li>Indentation</li>
          <li>Variations of the <code>range()</code> function</li>
        </ul>

      Step 16: Programming Exercise PE-BA-02
    </h4>
    <p>
      In the previous step, after initially exploring the Python
      <code>for</code> loop, we looked at a number of puzzles.
    </p>
    <p>In this step, let’s look at a few exercises.</p>
    <p><strong>Exercises</strong></p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Print the even numbers up to 10. We would want to print 2 4 6 8 10,
        using a for loop.
      </li>
      <li>Print the first 10 numbers in reverse</li>
      <li>Print the first 10 even numbers in reverse</li>
      <li>Print the squares of the first 10 numbers</li>
      <li>Print the squares of the first 10 numbers, in reverse</li>
      <li>Print the squares of the even numbers</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Solution 1</strong></p>
    <p>
      Instead of starting with <code>1</code>, we need to start with
      <code>2</code>. Each time, <code>i</code> it would be incremented by
      <code>2</code>, and <code>2 4 6 8 and 10</code> would be printed.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range (2,11,2):
    ...   print(i)
    ...
    2
    4
    6
    8
    10</code></pre>
    <p><strong>Solution 2</strong></p>
    <p>
      We would want to print the numbers in reverse. Think about how you would
      do that using the <code>range()</code> function. We’d want go from
      <code>10</code>, <code>9</code>, <code>8</code>, and so on up to
      <code>1</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range (10,0,-1):
    ...   print(i)
    ...
    10
    9
    8
    7
    6
    5
    4
    3
    2
    1</code></pre>
    <p>
      The value to start with is <code>10</code>. As we discussed earlier, the
      end value is exclusive. So to print from <code>10</code> to
      <code>1</code>, we want to end one value which is <code>0</code>.
      <code>range(10, 0)</code> seems to be what we need.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually these step value is positive, but we need to go backwards from
      <code>10</code>. Hence, we would give a step value of <code>-1</code>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Solution 3</strong></p>
    <p>Now, let’s print the first <code>10</code> even numbers in reverse.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range (20,0,-2):
    ...   print(i)
    ...

    12
    10
    8
    6
    4
    2</code></pre>
    <p><strong>Solution 4</strong></p>
    <p>Next, we would want to print the squares of the first 10 numbers.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range (1,11):
    ...     print(i * i)
    ...
    1
    4
    9
    16
    25
    36
    49
    64
    81
    100</code></pre>
    <p><strong>Solution 5</strong></p>
    <p>Let’s print the squares in the reverse order.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range (10,0,-1):
    ...     print(i*i)
    ...
    100
    81
    64
    49
    36
    25
    16
    9
    4
    1</code></pre>
    <p><strong>Solution 6</strong></p>
    <p>Print the squares of the even numbers. How to do that?</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range (10,0,-2):
    ...     print(i*i)
    ...
    100
    64
    36
    16
    4</code></pre>
    <p>The key part is using a step of <code>-2</code></p>
    <p>We leave it as an exercise for you, to print squares of odd numbers.</p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>
      In this video, we: * Tried out a few exercises involving the for loop, by
      playing around with printing sequences of numbers.

      Step 17: Review: The Basics Of Python
    </h4>
    <p>
      It must have been a roller-coaster ride to solve the multiplication table
      challenge so far. If you’re new to programming, there are a wide range of
      topics and concepts, that you would have learned during this small
      journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s quickly revise the important concepts we have learned during this
      small journey.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>1</code>, <code>11</code>, <code>5</code>, … are all called
        literals because these are constant values. Their values don’t really
        change. _Consider
        <code
          >5 _ 4 _ 50`. This is an expression. `_`is an operator, and`5`,
          `4`and`50</code
        >
        are operands.
      </li>
      <li>
        The name <code>i</code> in <code>i = 1</code>, is called a variable. It
        can refer to different values, at different points in time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>range()</code> and <code>print()</code> are in-built Python
        functions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Every complete line of code is called statement. The specific statement
        <code>print()</code>, is invoking a method. The other statement which we
        looked at earlier, was an assignment statement.
        <code>index = index + 1</code> would evaluate <code>index + 1</code>,
        and have the <code>index</code> variable refer to that value.
      </li>
      <li>
        The syntax of the <code>for</code> loop was very simple.
        <code>for var in range(1, 10) : ...</code>, followed by statements you
        would want to execute in a loop, with indentation. For the sake of
        indentation we left four <code>&lt;SPACE&gt;</code>s in front of each
        statement inside the <code>for</code> loop.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So that, in a nutshell, is what we have learned over the course of our
      first section.
    </p>
    <h3 id="chapter-03---introducing-methods">
      Chapter 03 - Introducing Methods
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the last section, we introduced you to the basics of python. We learned
      those concepts by applying them to solve the
      <em>PMT-Challenge</em> problem. The code below is what we ended up with as
      we solved that chellenge.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Snippet-01: Current Solution To PMT-Challenge</strong></p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range (1,11):
    ...   print(f&quot;8 * {i} = {8 * i}&quot;)</code></pre>
    <p>
      If we wanted to change the code to print the <code>7</code> table, we need
      to change the value <code>7</code> used in the for loop, to
      <code>8</code>. It’s simple, but still not as friendly as you would like.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range (1,11):
    ...   print(f&quot;7 * {i} = {7 * i}&quot;)</code></pre>
    <p>
      To print a <code>7</code> table, it would be awesome if could say
      <code>print_multiplication_table</code>, and give a value of 7 beside it,
      and it would do the rest:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_multiplication_table(7)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    NameError: name &#39;print_multiplication_table&#39; is not defined
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_multiplication_table(8)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    NameError: name &#39;print_multiplication_table&#39; is not defined</code></pre>
    <p>
      Similarly, <code>print_multiplication_table(8)</code>, could print the
      multiplication table for <code>8</code>!
    </p>
    <p>
      To be able to do this, we need to create a <strong>method</strong>, or a
      <strong>function</strong>. Creating a method makes the code
      <em>reusable</em>, and we can invoke that method very easily by passing
      <em>arguments</em>.
    </p>
    <p>In this section, we take an in-depth look at methods.</p>
    <h4 id="step-01-defining-your-first-method">
      Step 01: Defining Your First Method
    </h4>
    <p>
      Methods are very important building blocks in Python programming. In this
      step, we will create a simple method that prints
      <code>"Hello World"</code>, twice.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Snippet-01:</strong></p>
    <p>
      When we talk about a method, we need to give it a name. We are already
      using an in-built Python method here, which is <code>print()</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Hello World&quot;)
    Hello World
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Hello World&quot;)
    Hello World</code></pre>
    <p>
      Similar to that, we need to give a name to our body of code. Let’s say the
      name is <code>print_hello_world_twice</code>.
    </p>
    <p>The syntax to create a method in Python is straightforward:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        At the start, use the keyword <code>def</code> followed by a space.
      </li>
      <li>
        Followed by name of the method - <code>print_hello_world_twice</code>.
      </li>
      <li>Add a pair of parenthesis: <code>()</code>.</li>
      <li>
        <p>
          This is followed by a colon <code>:</code> (similar to what we used in
          a <code>for</code> loop).
        </p>
        <pre class="text"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def print_hello_world_twice():
...     print(&quot;Hello World&quot;)
...     print(&quot;Hello World&quot;)
...</code></pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All statements in a method should be indented. The two
      <code>print("Hello World")</code> are indented. So, they are part of the
      method body.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>print_hello_world_twice()</code> defines a method, and it has
      certain code inside its body.
    </p>
    <p>
      How do we call this method? Is it sufficient to say
      <code>print_hello_world_twice</code>?
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_hello_world_twice
    &lt;function print_hello_world_twice at 0x10a71ef28&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
      Python Shell says, there’s a function defined with that specific name.
    </p>
    <p>
      How do we execute a method? Very simple! Add a pair of parentheses to the
      name, <code>()</code>!
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_hello_world_twice()
    Hello World
    Hello World
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_hello_world_twice()
    Hello World
    Hello World</code></pre>
    <p>Now, we are able to run the method.</p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>In this step, we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learned we can define our own methods in the code we write</li>
      <li>Understood how to define a method, and all its syntax elements</li>
      <li>Saw how we can invoke a method we write</li>

    <p><strong>Solution 2</strong></p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; def print_your_progress():
    ...     print(&quot;Statement 1&quot;)
    ...     print(&quot;Statement 2&quot;)

        print(&quot;Statement 4&quot;)</code></pre>
    <p>
      For convenience, we have changed the exact text we need to print. Call
      this method with the syntax <code>print_your_progress()</code>, and you’re
      able to execute its code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now try another exercise. We want to print <code>"Statement 1"</code>,
      <code>"Statement 2"</code>, <code>"Statement 3"</code> and
      <code>"Statement 4"</code> on different lines, using just one print
      statement. How can you do that?
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; def print_your_progress():

    Statement 1
    Statement 2
    Statement 3
    Statement 4</code></pre>
    <p>We are using the newline character <code>\n</code>.</p>
    <p>Let’s look at the difference between defining and executing a method.</p>
    <p>
      When we are writing a method definition, we are writing the code as part
      of its body. It has a specific syntax, and starts with the
      <code>def</code> keyword.
    </p>
    <p>
      A definition by itself cannot cause the code in its body to be executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>print_your_progress()</code> represents a method call. The code
      inside the method is executed.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>In this step, we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Implemented solutions to a few exercises that test our understanding of
        Python methods. We touched concepts such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Defining a method body</li>
          <li>The way to invoke a method, to run its code</li>

    <h4 id="step-03-passing-parameters-to-methods">
      Step 03: Passing Parameters To Methods
    </h4>
    <p>
      In the previous step,we created methods. We defined
      <code>print_hello_world_twice()</code>, and this printed
      <code>"Hello World"</code> twice. In this step, let’s talk about
      <em>method arguments</em>, or <em>parameters</em>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Snippet-01:</strong></p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_hello_world_twice()
    Hello World
    Hello World
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_hello_world_thrice()
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World</code></pre>
    <p>
      Earlier, we wrote code for <code>print_hello_world_thrice()</code>, which
      prints the message three times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s say you want to print it five times. You would need to write another
      method that does what you need. Doesn’t that seem monotonous?
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of that, Won’t it be great if I can call the method by the same
      name, say <code>print_hello_world(5)</code>, and it would print “Hello
      World” five times?
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>5</code> which we are passing here is called an
      <strong>argument</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>How do we define our method to accept this argument?</p>
    <p>
      Let’s call our argument <code>no_of_times</code>. If you have any
      experience with other programming languages, they generally need you to
      specify the parameter type. Something like
      <code>This parameter is an integer/float/string, or other types</code>.
      But Python does not require parameter type.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; def print_hello_world(no_of_times):
    ...    print(&quot;Hello World&quot;)
    ...    print(no_of_times)
    ...</code></pre>
    <p>
      Although we are not doing exactly what we set out to, let’s see what would
      happen. What would happen if we say <code>print_hello_world()</code> ?
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_hello_world()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    TypeError: print_hello_world() missing 1 required positional argument: &#39;no_of_times&#39;</code></pre>
    <p>
      Error! Something like “Hey, you have created
      <code>print_hello_world</code> with a parameter, but not passing anything
      in here! Go ahead and pass a value”. Let’s pass in a value, such as
      <code>5</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_hello_world(5)
    Hello World
    5
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_hello_world(10)
    Hello World
    10
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_hello_world(100)
    Hello World
    100</code></pre>
    <p>
      With <code>print_hello_world(5)</code>, you can see
      <code>"Hello World"</code> and <code>5</code> being printed. We are now
      able to define this method to accept a value, and print that value by
      invoking it. You can pass in any value, such as<code>10</code>,
      <code>100</code>, or others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now think of a different solution for this method, where you don’t repeat
      the same piece of code to print <code>"Hello World"</code>. Consider
      <code>print_hello_world(5)</code>, it should still print
      <code>"Hello World"</code> <code>5</code> times. How do you do that?
    </p>
    <p>Think about using something along the lines of a loop.</p>
    <p><strong>Snippet-02:</strong></p>
    <p>
      For now, what we are doing is we are printing <code>"Hello World"</code>
      <code>10</code> times.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; def print_hello_world(no_of_times):
    ...    for i in range(1,10):
    ...       print(&quot;Hello World&quot;)
    ...

    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_hello_world(5)
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World</code></pre>
    <p>
      Our method call <code>print_hello_world(5)</code> now prints
      <code>"Hello World"</code> <code>10</code> times.
    </p>
    <p>
      However just print the message <code>5</code> times. We need to make use
      of the parameter <code>no_of_times</code> inside the <code>for</code> loop
      as well.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; def print_hello_world(no_of_times):
    ...    for i in range(1,no_of_times):
    ...       print(&quot;Hello World&quot;)
    ...

    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_hello_world(5)
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World</code></pre>
    <p>
      Now let’s execute the method again. You can see that it’s printing
      <code>4</code> times only.
    </p>
    <p>Why is it not printing <code>5</code> times?</p>
    <p>
      That’s because <code>no_of_times</code> as a second parameter to
      <code>range()</code> is exclusive.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; def print_hello_world(no_of_times):
    ...    for i in range(1,no_of_times+1):
    ...       print(&quot;Hello World&quot;)
    ...
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_hello_world(5)
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World</code></pre>
    <p>Great, it’s now printing the message <code>5</code> times!</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_hello_world(7)
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World</code></pre>
    <p>
      If you pass a different argument like <code>7</code>, the message is
      displayed <code>7</code> times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something you need to always be cautious about in Python, is the
      indentation. Over here, the <code>for</code> loop is part of the method
      body. So we have extra indentation for it. The print is part of the
      <code>for</code> loop body. So guess what, even more indentation for that
      code.

    <p>
      In this step, Let’s look at a few exercises related to the method

    </p>
    <p><strong>Exercises</strong></p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Write a method called <code>print_numbers()</code>, that would print all
        successive integers from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The second one is to write a method called
        <code>print_squares_of_numbers()</code>, that prints squares of all
        successive integers from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Solutions</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Solution 1</strong></p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; def print_numbers(n):

    2
    3
    4
    5
    &gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
      If you are programming in other languages such as Java, you are used to
      naming methods in this way: <code>printNumbers()</code>. This convention
      is popularly known as “Camel Case”.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s NOT how Python programmers name their methods. Pythonic way is to
      use underscore <code>_</code> to separate words in the method name, as in
      <code>print_numbers()</code>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Solution 2</strong></p>
    <p>
      Let’s define <code>print_squares_of_numbers()</code>. This would be very
      similar to <code>print_numbers()</code>, working with the same range.
      Only, we need to say <code>print(i*i)</code> .
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; def print_squares_of_numbers(n):
    ...    for i in range(1, n+1):
    ...       print(i*i)

    9
    16
    25</code></pre>
    <p>How is a parameter different from an argument?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Inside the definition of the method, the name within parentheses is
        referred to as a <strong>parameter</strong>. In our recent exercise,
        <code>n</code> is a parameter, because it’s used in the definition of
        <code>print_squares_of_numbers</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you are passing a value to a method during a method call, say
        <code>5</code>, that value is called an <strong>argument</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don’t worry too much about it. Just follow this convention for now:
        <ul>
          <li>In the method call, call it an <em>argument</em>.</li>
          <li>In a method definition, call it a <em>parameter</em>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

      Step 05: Methods With Multiple Parameters

    <p><strong>Snippet-01:</strong></p>
    <p>
      <code>print_hello_world</code> accepts one parameter and prints “Hello

      Let’s say we want to print another piece of text
      <code>Welcome To Python</code>, a specified number of times. How do you do
      that?
    </p>
    <p>
      You can always create another method similar to the first one, such as
      <code>print_welcome_to_python(no_of_times)</code> and print the necessary
      text inside.
    </p>
    <p>However, is that what a good programmer does?</p>
    <p>A good programmer tries to create a more generic solution.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; def print_string(str, no_of_times):

    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World</code></pre>
    <p>
      The good programmer that you are, you created a new method called
      <code>print_string(str, no_of_times)</code> accepting a text parameter, in
      addition to <code>no_of_times</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Syntax rules for method parameters are quite strict. If we say
      <code>print_string("Welcome to Python")</code> and run it, we get an
      error! Python Shell says: “I need <code>no_of_times</code> to be present
      in here”.

      want to always print <code>"Hello World"</code>, and that too
      <code>5</code> times.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Python language makes this very easy.
      <code>def print_string(str = "Hello World", no_of_times=5)</code>. The
      rest of the method remains the same.
    </p>

      Step 06: Back To Multiplication Table - Using Methods
    </h4>
    <p>
      Let’s get back to our original goal, of why we needed methods. We wanted
      to create a multiplication table for a number, and observed that each time
      we needed to we needed change that number, we were forced to make a change
      in the code. This is not something we liked, and that’s why we started
      investigating how methods can be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this step, Let’s try our hand at creating a multiplication table
      method.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Snippet-01:</strong></p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range (1,11):
    ...    print(f&quot;7 * {i} = {7 * i}&quot;)</code></pre>
    <p>
      Let’s define a method called <code>print_multiplication_table()</code>,
      and pass in a parameter to it.
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; def print_multiplication_table(table):
    ...    for i in range(1,11):
    ...       print(f&quot;{table} * {i} = {table * i}&quot;)
    ...
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_multiplication_table(7)
    7 * 1 = 7
    7 * 2 = 14
    7 * 3 = 21
    7 * 4 = 28
    7 * 5 = 35
    7 * 6 = 42
    7 * 7 = 49
    7 * 8 = 56
    7 * 9 = 63
    7 * 10 = 70</code></pre>
    <p>Now you have the entire multiplication table for <code>7</code>.</p>
    <p>
      You can then call <code>print_multiplication_table()</code> with arguments
      <code>8</code>, <code>9</code>,and so on, by simply changing the
      <code>table</code> arguemnt value.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now want to create even better
      <code>print_multiplication_table()</code> method.
    </p>
    <p>
      We want to control the start point, as well as the end point, in the call
      to <code>range()</code>. We want to say
      <code>print_multiplication_table(7, 1, 6)</code>, to print the
      <code>7</code> table with entries from <code>1</code> to <code>6</code>.
      How can you do that?

    ...
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_multiplication_table(7, 1 , 6)
    7 * 1 = 7
    7 * 2 = 14
    7 * 3 = 21
    7 * 4 = 28
    7 * 5 = 35
    7 * 6 = 42</code></pre>
    <p>Simple! Define those range limits as additional parameters!</p>
    <p>
      The other thing we can obviously do, is have default values for the
      <code>start</code>, and the <code>end</code>.
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; def print_multiplication_table(table, start=1, end=10):
    ...    for i in range(start, end+1):
    ...       print(f&quot;{table} * {i} = {table * i}&quot;)
    ...

    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_multiplication_table(7)
    7 * 1 = 7
    7 * 2 = 14
    7 * 3 = 21
    7 * 4 = 28
    7 * 5 = 35
    7 * 6 = 42
    7 * 7 = 49
    7 * 8 = 56
    7 * 9 = 63
    7 * 10 = 70</code></pre>
    <p>
      Calling <code>print_multiplication_table(7)</code> would give us entries
      from <code>7 * 1 = 7</code> to <code>7 * 10 = 70</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you can actually send out this method, to your friends, who would find
      it easy to use, and cool!

    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>In this step, we:</p>

      <li>
        Learned how to define a method to print the multiplication table for a

    <h4 id="step-07-indentation-is-king">Step 07: Indentation Is King</h4>
    <p>
      In Python, indentation denote blocks of code. So if you want to put
      something in a <code>for</code> loop, or outside it, proper indentation
      would be sufficient. In this step, let’s explore indentation in depth.
      Let’s start by creating a simple method.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Snippet-01:</strong></p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; def method_to_understand_indentation():

    <p>
      Consider the code below: <code>print(5)</code> is indented at the same
      level as <code>for loop</code>.
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; def method_to_understand_indentation():
    ...     for i in range(1,11) :
    ...        print(i)
    ...     print(5)
    ...</code></pre>
    <p>
      You can see that <code>print(5)</code> is called only once. It is not part
      of the <code>for loop</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; method_to_understand_indentation()

    10
    5</code></pre>
    <p>
      Let’s change the code in this method a bit. <code>print(5)</code> is
      indented the same way as <code>print(i)</code>
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; def method_to_understand_indentation():

    ...</code></pre>
    <p>
      <code>print(5)</code> is part of the for loop. It is executed 10 times.

    <p>
      Whether we’re talking about loops, methods or conditionals, proper
      indentation is very important in Python.
    </p>
    <p>
      We indicate a block of code, by having all lines of that block at the same
      indentation level. There are no specific delimiters like for instance a
      pair of braces <code>{...}</code>, as in other programming languages.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>In this step, we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ran through a few examples to see how indentation works in Python</li>

    <h4 id="step-08-puzzles-on-methods---named-parameters">
      Step 08: Puzzles on Methods - Named Parameters
    </h4>
    <p>In this step, let’s look at a variety of puzzles related to methods.</p>
    <p><strong>Snippet-01:</strong></p>
    <p>
      Consider the following method: I would want to print the default string 6
      times. How do we do it?
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; def print_string(str=&quot;Hello World&quot;, no_of_times=5):
    ...     for i in range(1,no_of_times+1):
    ...        print(str)
    ...
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_string()
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World</code></pre>
    <p>
      Will it work if we call the method as in: <code>print_string(6)</code>?
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_string(6)
    6
    6
    6
    6
    6</code></pre>
    <p>
      <code>6</code> is passed as the first parameter. <code>6</code> is matched
      to <code>str</code>, and the method prints <code>6</code> the default
      number of times, which is <code>5</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      to default to <code>"Hello World"</code>, and print it
      <code>6</code> times.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can do this in Python by using <strong>named parameters</strong>.
      During the method call, you can specify <code>no_of_times = 6</code>.
      <strong><code>no_of_times</code></strong> is a named parameter.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        There is no provision of doing something like this, in other languages
        like Java.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Call it as <code>print_string(no_of_times=6)</code>:</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_string(no_of_times=6)
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World</code></pre>
    <p>
      <code>str</code> gets a default value, and <code>"Hello World"</code> is
      printed <code>6</code> times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Named parameters are very useful, when a method has a number of
      parameters, and you would want to make it very clear which parameter
      you’re passing a value for.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s call <code>print_string(7, 8)</code>. what happens?</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_string(7, 8)
    7
    7
    7
    7
    7
    7
    7
    7</code></pre>
    <p>You would see that <code>7</code> is printed <code>8</code> times.</p>
    <p>
      Since <code>print()</code> method is quite flexible, you can pass a number
      as the first argument. You can even pass a <code>float</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_string(7.5, 8)
    7.5
    7.5
    7.5
    7.5
    7.5
    7.5
    7.5
    7.5</code></pre>
    <p>
      What would be the result of this -
      <code>print_string(7.5, "eight")</code>?
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; print_string(7.5, &quot;eight&quot;)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 2, in print_string
    TypeError: must be str, not int</code></pre>
    <p>
      Note how <code>no_of_times</code> is used inside the method… as an
      argument to <code>range()</code>. <code>range()</code> only accepts
      integers, nothing else. When you run the code with
      <code>print_string(7.5, "eight")</code>, we get an error.
    </p>
    <p>
      It says:
      <code>TypeError: ```no_of_times``` must be ```int```, not string</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A simple rule of thumb is, if you have a parameter, you can pass any type
      of data to it. That could be an integer, a floating point value a string,
      or a boolean value. The Python language does not check for the type of a
      parameter. However, Python will throw an error if the function which is
      using that parameter, expects it to be of a specific type. The
      <code>range()</code> function expects that the <code>no_of_times</code> is
      an integer value.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Snippet-02:</strong></p>
    <p>
      The last thing which we would be looking at, is method naming conventions.
      We named our methods in a consistent way: <code>print_string</code>,
      <code>print_multiplication_table</code>, and the like.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is exactly the format which most Python developers use, to name their
      methods.
    </p>
    <p>Convention is to use underscore to separate words in a name.</p>
    <p>
      However, there are a few rules for naming a method: One of the important
      rules is also related to variable names. We observed that a variable name
      cannot start with a number.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; def 1_print():
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1
        def 1_print():
             ^
    SyntaxError: invalid token</code></pre>
    <p>
      Similarly, <code>1_print</code> will not be accepted as a method name.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can start a name with an alphabet, or with an underscore.</li>
      <li>
        From the second character onward, you are allowed to use numeric
        symbols.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Methods and variables cannot be named using Python keywords.</p>
    <p>
      Now, what is a keyword? For example, when we talked about
      <code>for</code> loop, as in:
    </p>
    <p><code>text</code>for i in range(1, 11): print(i)<code>...</code></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong><code>for</code></strong> is a keyword
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><code>in</code></strong> is a keyword
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><code>def</code></strong> is a keyword.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Later we will look at a few other keywords, such as
      <strong><code>while</code></strong
      >, <strong><code>return</code></strong
      >, <strong><code>if</code></strong
      >, <strong><code>else</code></strong
      >, <strong><code>elif</code></strong
      >, and many more.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; def def():
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1
        def def():

    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    &gt;&gt;&gt; def in():
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1
        def in():
             ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax

    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>In this step, we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Were introduced to the concept of named parameters</li>
      <li>
        Explored the typical naming rules and conventions for methods in Python
      </li>
      <li>
        Observed that reserved keywords cannot be used to name variables or
        methods
      </li>

    <h4 id="step-09-methods---return-values">
      Step 09: Methods - Return Values
    </h4>
    <p>
      Let’s try and understand the importance of return values from a method. We
      will learn how to return a value from a method.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Snippet-01:</strong></p>
    <p>
      Let’s name our method as <code>product_of_two_numbers()</code>, and let’s
      have parameters <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> that it accepts:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; def product_of_two_numbers(a,b):
    ...     print(a * b)
    ...
    &gt;&gt;&gt; product_of_two_numbers(1,2)
    2</code></pre>
    <p>
      Can we take the product of these two numbers into a variable, and use it
      in other code, in the same program?
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose we say a <code>product = product_of_two_numbers(1,2)</code>, is
      this allowed?
    </p>
    <p>Let’s run this code, and see what’s stored in <code>product</code>.</p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; product = product_of_two_numbers(1,2)
    2
    &gt;&gt;&gt; product</code></pre>
    <p>It’s empty.</p>
    <p>
      The <code>product_of_two_numbers()</code> method is not really returning
      anything back, to be used elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have a look at some of the built-in Python functions, such as
      <code>max()</code> for example.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; max(1,2,3)
    3
    &gt;&gt;&gt; max(1,2,3,4)
    4
    &gt;&gt;&gt; maximum = max(1,2,3,4)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; maximum
    4
    &gt;&gt;&gt; maximum * 5
    20</code></pre>
    <p>
      If I call <code>max()</code> with four parameters, as in
      <code>maximum = max(1,2,3,4)</code>, the value <code>4</code> gets stored
      in maximum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on in the code that follows, we can say <code>maximum * 5</code>, or
      we can print the value of <code>maximum</code>, or a similar calculation.
      This gives our programs a lot more flexibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      So instead of just printing <code>a*b</code>, if this function could
      return a value, that would be quite useful.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; def product_of_two_numbers(a,b):
    ...      product = a * b;
    ...      return product
    ...
    &gt;&gt;&gt; product_of_two_numbers(2,3)
    6</code></pre>
    <p>
      We are creating a variable <code>product</code> and doing a
      <code>return product</code>.
    </p>
    <p>Lets run <code>product_result = product_of_two_numbers(2, 3)</code></p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; product_result = product_of_two_numbers(2,3)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; product_result
    6
    &gt;&gt;&gt; product_result * 10
    60</code></pre>
    <p>You can see how simple it is to return values from a method!</p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>In this step, we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learned how to return values from inside a method</li>
      <li>Observed how we can store the values returned by a method call</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="step-10-programming-exercise-pe-md-02">
      Step 10: Programming Exercise PE-MD-02
    </h4>
    <p>
      In this step let’s look at a couple of exercises about returning values
      from methods.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Exercises</strong></p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Write a method to return the sum of three integers.</li>
      <li>
        Write a method which takes as input two integers, representing two
        angles of a triangle, and computes the third angle.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Hint: The sum of the angles in a triangle is <code>180</code> degrees. So
      if I am passing <code>50</code> and <code>50</code>, <code>50</code> plus
      <code>50</code> is <code>100</code>. So some of three angles should be
      <code>180</code>, so the third angle will be <code>180 - 100</code>, which
      is <code>80</code>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Solution 1</strong></p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt;def sum_of_three_numbers(a, b, c):
    ...     sum = a + b + c
    ...     return sum
    ...

    &gt;&gt;&gt; sum_of_three_numbers(1,2,3)
    6
    &gt;&gt;&gt; something = sum_of_three_numbers(1,2,3)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; something * 5
    30</code></pre>
    <p>
      The shorter way of doing that would have been to have a temporary variable
      called instead of <code>sum</code>. We could directly
      <code>return a + b + c</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; def sum_of_three_numbers(a, b, c):
    ...     return a + b + c
    ...
    &gt;&gt;&gt; something = sum_of_three_numbers(1,2,3)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; something * 5
    30</code></pre>
    <p>
      In methods, you can use <code>return expression</code> as well. That
      <code>expression</code> gets evaluated, and the value gets returned back.
      You’d see that the result remains the same.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Solution 2</strong></p>
    <p>
      The second is to write a method to take two integers, representing two
      angles of a triangle, and compute the third one.
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; def calculate_third_angle(first, second) :
    ...     return 180 - ( first + second )
    ...
    &gt;&gt;&gt; calculate_third_angle(50, 20)
    110</code></pre>
    <p>
      In your programming career, you would be writing a number of methods. It’s
      very important that you are comfortable doing so. Most of the methods that
      you write would return values back.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s the reason why we’re creating a lot of examples involving method
      calls.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>In this step, we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Looked at a couple of exercises related to returning values from methods
      </li>
      <li>
        Observed that returning expressions avoids creating unnecessary
        variables, and shortens method definitions

        >Writing and Executing your First Python Script</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>Let’s get started with creating a simple script file.</p>
    <p>
      We want to type in a simple Python script, or a piece of Python code, such
      as <code>print("Hello world")</code>. Does it get any simpler than this?
    </p>
    <p>
      We’ll save this into any folder on our hard disk, with a name ‘first.py’ .
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>first.py</strong></em>
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>print(&quot;Hello world&quot;)</code></pre>
    <p>
      The ‘.py’ is not really mandatory, but typically all python files end with
      a ‘.py’ extension.
    </p>
    <p>Here’s how you can run it:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Launch your terminal, or command prompt</li>
      <li>‘cd’ to the folder where this python script file is saved</li>
      <li>execute the command <code>python first.py</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>You will see that <code>Hello World</code> will be printed.</p>
    <p>
      If you are familiar with other programming languages, you would need a
      class, need to put the code in that class, and similar stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Python supports Object Oriented Programming, is not mandatory to
      create a class.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s almost as if you’re typing commands, starting from the line one!
      That’s why we call it a python script.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>
      In this small step, we tried to create a simple python script, and we ran
      it from the command line. All we needed to do, was use the same command we
      use to launch up the python shell, and followed it up with a name of the
      file. We created a file called first.py, executed that, and were able to
      see the output on the console.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an exercise, try and add a few more methods and try to run those
      methods as well, as part of this script.
    </p>
    <h4 id="step-02---python-virtual-machine-and-bytecode">
      Step 02 - Python virtual machine and bytecode
    </h4>
    <p>
      In this step, let’s try and understand what’s happening in the background.
    </p>
    <p>
      We wrote a simple piece of code using a text editor. We created a file
      named first.py, and all we did was: <code>python3 first.py</code>. If you
      look at other languages like Java for example, there is a separate
      compilation phase and then an execution phase. But with Python, just this
      command does both compilation and execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      We saw that, as soon as we make a change and we run
      <code>python3 first.py</code> , the change is compiled and executed as
      well!
    </p>
    <p>
      In Python, there is an intermediate format called
      <strong>Python byte code</strong>. Code is first compiled to bytecode, and
      then executed on the <strong>Python virtual machine</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we installed Python, we installed both the python compiler and
      interpreter, as well as the virtual machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Python, <code>bytecode</code> is not standardized. Different
      implementations of Python have different byte code. There are about 80
      Python implementations, like CPython and Jython.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>CPython is a Python implementation in C language.</li>
      <li>
        Jython is a Python implementation in Java language. The bytecode which
        Jython uses is actually Java bytecode, and you can run it on the Java
        virtual machine.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Python leaves a lot of flexibility to the implementations of Python. They
      have the flexibility to choose the bytecode, and to choose the virtual
      machine that is compatible. The bytecode is tied to the specific virtual
      machine you are using. Therefore, if you’re using CPython to compile the
      bytecode, you’ll not be able to use Jython to run it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should make sure, that whatever implementation you are using to
      compile, is the same one you’re using to run the code as well.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>
      A lot of this sounds like boring theory. Don’t worry about it. As a
      beginner, this might not be very important for you right now.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s very important for you to understand the process. What’s happening is
      you were writing Python code, and when you ran the command
      <code>python3 first.py</code>, it is both compiled and executed. An
      intermediate format called bytecode is created, which is not really
      standardized in Python. The bytecode is executed in a Python virtual
      machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea behind this quick section, is to give you a little bit of
      background on what’s happening behind the scenes. I’ll see you in the next
      section. Until then, bye-bye!

    <p>
      Go to Google and type in “VSCode Community Edition Download”. Click the
      link which comes up first:
      <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/VSCode/download"
        >https://www.jetbrains.com/VSCode/download</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      You’ll go to a page where you can choose the operating system: whether you
      are on Windows, Mac, or Linux.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you choose that, you can download the appropriate community version.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the right hand side, you’ll see a community version, and you can click

    </p>
    <p>
      If you are having a problem, you can also use the direct link to download.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you download VSCode, all you need to do is double-click the package
      which is downloaded. Follow the instructions, and you can continue with
      the defaults, until you completely install VSCode.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you launch VSCode for the first time, it should ask you for a theme,
      where you can choose the default.
    </p>
    <p>You’re all set to go ahead with the next step in the course.</p>
    <p>VSCode is an awesome IDE, and I’m sure you learn a lot about it.</p>

    <p>
      In this step, let’s launch up the VSCode IDE, and create our first Python
      project with a Python script. We want to be able to launch a Python script
      by the end of this step.
    </p>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Launch the VSCode IDE. You’ll see that it takes a little while to launch
      the first time, and then brings up a welcome screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      We would want to create a number of Python files. All these files will be
      in a project. You can think of our project as a collection of Python
      scripts, or modules.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get started, let’s create a new project by clicking ‘create new
      project’. Let’s name it - ‘01-first-python-project’.
    </p>
    <p>Right now there are no files in the project.</p>
    <p>Let’s create our first Python file, using the IDE.</p>
    <p>
      The way you can do that is by saying ‘right-click’ -&gt; ‘new’ -&gt;
      ‘Python file’, and then we’ll give this a name of ‘hello_world’, and click
      OK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you can go ahead and write your first Python program. Let’s write some
      simple code, like <code>print("Hello World")</code>, and save it.
    </p>
    <p>You can do a right-click here, and say ‘Run hello_world’.</p>

      Chapter 06 - Introducing Data Types and Conditionals
    </h3>
    <p>
      Welcome to this section, where we will talk about numeric data types, and
      conditional program execution. After looking at the numeric and boolean
      data types, we will turn our attention to executing code, based on logical
      conditions.
    </p>
    <h4 id="step-01-numeric-data-types">Step 01: Numeric Data Types</h4>
    <p>
      In previous sections, we created variables of this kind:
      <code>number = 5</code> , <code>value = 2.5</code>, etc. The
      <code>5</code> here is an integer, and integers represent numbers, such as
      <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>6</code>, <code>-1</code> and
      <code>-2</code>. In Python, the <code>class</code> for this particular
      data type is <code>int</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you write code like <code>type(5)</code>, you’d get
      <code>'int'</code> as the output.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Python, there are no primitive types. What does that mean? Every value
      that you see in a Python program, is an object, an instance of some
      <code>class</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In later sections, We’ll understand what is a <code>class</code>, and what
      is an object or an instance. For now, the most important thing for you to
      remember, is that behind every value, there is a <code>class</code>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Snippet-01:</strong></p>
    <p>Let’s look at <code>2.5</code>, which is a floating point value.</p>
    <p>
      If you go ahead and do <code>type(2.5)</code>, what would you see? You
      would see it’s of type `<code>float</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; type(2.5)
    &lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; type(2.55)
    &lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
      When you perform a division operation between two integers, there is a
      chance that the result of the operation is a <code>float</code>. If you do
      <code>5/2</code>, the result is <code>2.5</code>. If we were to do
      <code>4/2</code>, even then it’s of type <code>float</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; type(5/2)
    &lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; type(4/2)
    &lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 4/2
    2.0
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 1 + 2
    3</code></pre>
    <p>
      All the operations we looked at until now, can also be performed on
      floating point values.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; value1 = 4.5
    &gt;&gt;&gt; value2 = 3.2
    &gt;&gt;&gt; value1 + value2
    7.7
    &gt;&gt;&gt; value1 - value2
    1.2999999999999998
    &gt;&gt;&gt; value1 / value2
    1.40625
    &gt;&gt;&gt; value1 % value2
    1.2999999999999998</code></pre>
    <p>
      <code>value1 - value2</code> returns <code>1.299999999999998</code>. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      Floating point numbers don’t really represent accurate values. That’s one
      of the things you need to always keep in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically, if you’re doing any highly sensitive financial calculations,
      don’t use <code>float</code>s to represent your values. Instead, use
      <code>Decimal</code>. More about it later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Operations can also be performed between <code>int</code> and
      <code>float</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; i + value1
    14.5
    &gt;&gt;&gt; i - value1
    5.5
    &gt;&gt;&gt; i / value1
    2.2222222222222223
    &gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
      Result of an operation between a <code>int</code> and a
      <code>float</code>, is always a <code>float</code>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>In this step, we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Looked at the two basic numeric types: <code>int</code> and
        <code>float</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Saw the basic operations you can do among <code>int</code>s, among
        <code>float</code>s, and also between <code>int</code>s and
        <code>float</code>s.

    </ul>
    <h4 id="step-02-programming-exercise-pe-dt-01">
      Step 02: Programming Exercise PE-DT-01
    </h4>
    <p>In this step, let’s do a simple exercise with numeric values.</p>
    <p><strong>Exercises</strong></p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        You need to create a method called <code>simple_interest</code>, and
        pass three parameters: <code>principal</code>, <code>interest</code> and
        <code>duration</code> (in years). You also want to calculate the amount
        after the specific duration, and return it back. Call this method with a
        few example values.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      For example, if you want to call <code>simple_interest</code> with
      <code>10000</code>, with an interest of <code>5</code> percent, for a
      duration of <code>5</code> years, the correct answer would be as follows:
      <code>10000</code> is the principal. In addition to <code>10000</code>,
      you get the interest. The interest for one year is
      <code>10000 * 0.05</code>, as the interest figure is in percentage.So
      that’s <code>500</code> a year, into <code>5</code> which is
      <code>2500</code>. The result would be <code>12500</code>, and this value
      should be printed.

    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

    <h4 id="step-03-puzzles-on-numeric-types">
      Step 03: Puzzles On Numeric Types
    </h4>
    <p>
      In this section, we are looking at numeric types. In this specific step,
      we would be looking at a few puzzles related to values of these types.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Snippet-01:</strong></p>
    <p>
      Let’s create a simple variable <code>i = 1</code>. <code>i = i + 1</code>.
      What would be the value of <code>i</code> after that?
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; i = 1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; i = i + 1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; i
    2</code></pre>
    <p>
      It would be <code>2</code>. There is a shortcut way of doing the same
      thing, by using the <code>+=</code> operator.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; i += 1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; i
    3</code></pre>
    <p>
      Typically in other programming languages, you can do something of this
      kind: <code>i++</code>. There is no provision in Python to use increment
      operators like <code>++</code>, in either prefix or suffix mode, like
      <code>++i</code>, or <code>i++</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; i++
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1
        i++
          ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    &gt;&gt;&gt; ++i
    3</code></pre>
    <p>Let’s look at compound assignments.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; i += 1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; i
    4
    &gt;&gt;&gt; i -= 1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; i
    3
    &gt;&gt;&gt; i /= 1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; i *= 2
    &gt;&gt;&gt; i
    6.0</code></pre>
    <p>
      What you see here, is Dynamic Typing in Python. The type of a variable can
      change during the lifetime of the program.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; i = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(i)
&lt;type &#39;int&#39;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; i = i/2.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(i)
&lt;type &#39;float&#39;&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
      Let’s create a couple more numbers. <code>number1 = 5</code> and
      <code>number2 = 2</code>. What could be the result of
      <code>number1 / number2</code>? You know it, it’s <code>2.5</code> .
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>number1 // nummber2</code> truncates the value of <code>2.5</code>,
      to <code>2</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; number1//number2
    2</code></pre>
    <p>
      If you can do <code>number1 // number2</code>, can you also do this:
      <code>number1 //= number2</code>?
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; number1 //= 2
    &gt;&gt;&gt; number1
    2</code></pre>
    <p>
      <code>5 ** 3</code> is <code>5</code> ‘to the power of’ <code>3</code>,
      which is <code>5 * 5 * 5</code>, or <code>125</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; 5 ** 3
    125
    &gt;&gt;&gt; pow(5,3)
    125</code></pre>
    <p>
      This can also be achieved by invoking <code>pow(5, 3)</code>. We have an
      operator, as well as a method at our disposal.
    </p>
    <p>The last thing we will look at, are type conversion functions.</p>
    <p>
      If you need to convert an <code>int</code> value to a <code>float</code>,
      or a <code>float</code> to an <code>int</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; int(5.6)
    5</code></pre>
    <p>
      What if you want to round a value? <code>5.6</code> is nearer to
      <code>6</code> than <code>5</code>. You can use a function called
      <code>round()</code>, and here,<code>round(5.6)</code> gives the correct
      result <code>6</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; round(5.6)
    6

      Step 04: Introducing Boolean Type
    </h4>
    <p>We will now shift our attention to the <code>bool</code> data type.</p>
    <p>A boolean value is something which can be either “true” or “false”.</p>
    <p><strong>Snippet-01:</strong></p>
    <p>
      In Python, “true” is represented by <code>True</code>, and “false” by
      <code>False</code>. It’s important to remember that it’s
      <code>True</code> with a capital <code>'T'</code>, and
      <code>False</code> with a capital <code>'F'</code>.

    <p>
      The boolean variable <code>is_even</code> indicates whether a number is
      even or not.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; is_even = True
    &gt;&gt;&gt; is_odd = False</code></pre>
    <p>
      Let’s create a variable <code>i = 10</code>. We want to find out if
      <code>i &gt; 15</code>. What do you think is the result?
      <code>False</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; i = 10

    False
    &gt;&gt;&gt; i &lt; 15
    True</code></pre>
    <p>
      In general, boolean values can represent the result of logical conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s look at other operations that can result in
      <code>bool</code> values. We looked at <code>&gt;</code> and
      <code>&lt;</code>. Another operation which you can perform, is
      <code>&gt;=</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; i &gt;= 15
    False
    &gt;&gt;&gt; i &gt;= 10

    &gt;&gt;&gt; i &lt;= 10
    True
    &gt;&gt;&gt; i &lt; 10
    False</code></pre>
    <p>
      <code>==</code> is the comparison operator. We are only comparing the
      value of <code>i</code> against <code>10</code>, not changing its value.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; i == 10

    <ul>
      <li>Were introduced to the <code>bool</code> data type</li>

        Learned that <code>bool</code> variables are useful handy while testing
        logical conditions
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="step-05-introducing-conditionals">
      Step 05: Introducing Conditionals
    </h4>
    <p>In this step, let’s look at <code>if</code> statement.</p>
    <p>
      Sometimes you need to execute code only when certain conditions are true.
      You can use a <code>if</code> condition, which is the simplest conditional
      in Python. Let’s look at an example.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Snippet-01:</strong></p>
    <p>
      Let’s say <code>i</code> has a value of <code>5</code>. You want to print
      something, only if <code>i</code> has a value greater than <code>3</code>.
      How do you do that?
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; i = 5
    &gt;&gt;&gt; if i&gt;3:
    ...     print(f&quot;{i} is greater than 3&quot;)
    ...
    5 is greater than 3</code></pre>
    <p>
      The syntax of the <code>if</code> is very simple: <code>if</code> followed
      by a condition; with the condition you want to check. It looks like:
      <code>if i&gt;3: ...</code> You need to indent the body of the
      <code>if</code> with <code>&lt;SPACE&gt;</code>s as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s say <code>i</code> has a value of <code>2</code>. What would happen
      if we execute the same code again?
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; i = 2
    &gt;&gt;&gt; if i&gt;3:
    ...     print(f&quot;{i} is greater than 3&quot;)
    ...</code></pre>
    <p>
      You would see that nothing is printed to the console. Based on the value
      of <code>i</code> , either the statement is executed, or it’s not. That’s
      what an <code>if</code> helps us to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way you can think about an <code>if</code>, is the body of code under
      the <code>if</code> is executed only when this condition is
      <code>True</code>. If this condition is not <code>True</code>, that code
      is not executed at all.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; if(False):
    ...   print(&quot;False&quot;)
    ...
    &gt;&gt;&gt; if(True):
    ...   print(&quot;True&quot;)
    ...
    True</code></pre>
    <p>
      Let’s take two different numbers, say <code>a = 5</code>, and
      <code>b = 7</code>. We want to compare them, and predict if
      <code>a</code> is greater that <code>b</code> .
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; a = 5
    &gt;&gt;&gt; b = 7
    &gt;&gt;&gt; if(a&gt;b):
    ...   print(&quot;a is greater than b&quot;)
    ...

    &gt;&gt;&gt; a = 9
    &gt;&gt;&gt; if(a&gt;b):
    ...   print(&quot;a is greater than b&quot;)
    ...
    a is greater than b</code></pre>

    <p><strong>Snippet-01:</strong></p>
    <p>
      Let’s say we define four variables: <code>a = 1</code>,

      Let’s say we are given three values meant to be the angles of a triangle.
      Their values are <code>angle1 = 30</code>, <code>angle2 = 20</code> and
      <code>angle3 = 60</code>. You want to find out if these three angles
      actually form a valid triangle. You know that the sum of the angles of a
      triangle is always <code>180</code> degrees.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; angle1 = 30

    <p>The last exercise is to check if a number is even or not.</p>

      Step 07 - Logical Operators - and or not
    </h4>
    <p>
      In this step, let’s look at the different operators that can be used on
      <code>bool</code> values. These operators are called logical operators -
      <code>and</code>, <code>or</code> , <code>not</code> and
      <code>^</code> (xor).
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s say we have a value <code>True</code>, and the other
      <code>False</code>, and we want to play around with them.

    <p>
      In this step, Let’s look at a few simple puzzles to look at the logical
      operators.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Snippet-01:</strong></p>
    <p>
      Let’s say <code>i</code> has a value of <code>10</code>, and
      <code>j</code> has a value of <code>15</code>. You want to find out if
      both <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> are even. How do you do that?
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; i = 10
    &gt;&gt;&gt; j = 15
    &gt;&gt;&gt; if i%2==0 and j%2==0:

    ...
    &gt;&gt;&gt; j = 14
    &gt;&gt;&gt; if i%2==0 and j%2==0:
    ...   print(&quot;i and j are even&quot;)
    ...
    i and j are even

    &gt;&gt;&gt; if i%2==0 or j%2==0:

        ^
    IndentationError: expected an indented block
    &gt;&gt;&gt; if i%2==0 or j%2==0:
    ...   print(&quot;atleast one of i and j are even&quot;)
    ...
    atleast one of i and j are even</code></pre>
    <p>
      If we want to find out if at least one of <code>i</code> and
      <code>j</code> is even, we can use the <code>or</code> operator.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; i = 15
    &gt;&gt;&gt; j
    14
    &gt;&gt;&gt; if i%2==0 or j%2==0:

    ...
    &gt;&gt;&gt; i
    15</code></pre>
    <p>
      Now try and guess the value of this.
      <code>if(True ^ False): print("Message")</code>
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; if(True ^ False):
    ...     print(&quot;This will Print&quot;)
    ...
    This will Print
    &gt;&gt;&gt; if(False ^ True):
    ...     print(&quot;This will Print&quot;)
    ...
    This will Print
    &gt;&gt;&gt; if(True ^ True):
    ...     print(&quot;This will Print&quot;)
    ...</code></pre>
    <p>
      Xor operation using <code>^</code> - message will get printed if the
      operands are different.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would happen if both of them are <code>True</code>? No message is
      printed.
    </p>
    <p>
      So you would use <code>^</code> in situations, where you’d want one of the
      operands to be <code>True</code>, and the other to be <code>False</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s say, <code>x = 5</code>, and you want to check
      <code>if not x == 6: print("This")</code>. What will be the result of
      running this code?
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; x = 5

    &gt;&gt;&gt; if not x == 6:
    ...   print(&quot;This&quot;)
    ...</code></pre>
    <p>
      Actually, there is a shortcut for such a condition:
      <code>if x != 6 : print("This")</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; if x!=6:
    ...   print(&quot;This&quot;)
    ...

    ...   print(&quot;This&quot;)
    ...
    This</code></pre>
    <p>
      <code>int()</code> is a conversion function, which when given say a
      <code>float</code> value, returns an <code>int</code> value. Consider
      <code>int(True)</code>, what would happen?
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; int(True)
    1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; int(False)
    0</code></pre>
    <p><code>int(True)</code> returns 1. <code>int(False)</code> returns 0.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; x = -6
    &gt;&gt;&gt; if x:
    ...   print(&quot;something&quot;)
    ...
    something</code></pre>
    <p>
      One of the most interesting facts about boolean stuff, is anything which
      is non-zero, is considered to be <code>True</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>0</code> is the only integer value which is considered to be
      <code>False</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; bool(6)
    True
    &gt;&gt;&gt; bool(-6)
    True
    &gt;&gt;&gt; bool(0)
    False
    &gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
      So, if I have a value of <code>x = -6</code>, and execute
      <code>if x: print("something")</code> what do you think will happen?
    </p>
    <p><code>"something"</code> will be printed.</p>
    <p>
      You can use the function <code>bool()</code>, to convert
      <code>int</code> to a <code>bool</code> value.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>bool(6)</code> returns <code>True</code></li>
      <li><code>bool(-6)</code> returns <code>True</code></li>
      <li><code>bool(0)</code> returns <code>False</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Except for <code>bool(0)</code>, all the other results would be
      <code>True</code>.

      <li>Looked at a few puzzles related to the logical operators</li>

    <h4 id="step-09">Step 09:</h4>
    <p>
      In this step, let’s look at two other important components of an
      <code>if</code> statement: <code>else</code> and <code>elif</code>. Let’s
      start with <code>else</code>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Snippet-01:</strong></p>
    <p>
      Consider a scenario where <code>i</code> has a value of <code>2</code>.
      Let’s try to print a message <code>"i is even"</code> if <code>i</code> is
      an even number. Otherwise, print <code>"i is odd"</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Earlier we wrote code along these lines:
      <code>if i % 2 == 0 : print("i is even")</code>. However if this condition
      is not <code>True</code>, we would want to <code>print("i is odd")</code>.
      How do we accomplish that?
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; i = 2
    &gt;&gt;&gt; if i%2 == 0:

    ...   print(&quot;i is odd&quot;);
    ...
    i is even</code></pre>

      An <code>else</code> clause provides an alternative code body to execute,

    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; i = 3

    <p>Let’s look at <code>elif</code>.</p>
    <p>
      We want to do something if <code>i</code> has value of <code>3</code>, and
      something totally different if <code>i</code> has a value of
      <code>4</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, we want to specify 2 alternatives to the
      <code>if</code> condition. How can that be done?
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; if i==1:

    ...   print(&quot;i is 2&quot;)
    ... else:
    ...   print(&quot;i is not 1 or 2&quot;)
    ...
    i is not 1 or 2
    &gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
      That’s where the <strong><code>elif</code></strong> clause comes into the
      picture. The code in <code>elif</code> is executed if the previous
      conditions are false and the current <code>elif</code> condition is true.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>In this step, we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Looked at two important components of the <code>if</code> statement:
        <code>else</code> and <code>elif</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Understood that the <code>elif</code> clauses and the final
        <code>else</code> clause provide alternative conditions to check, when
        earlier if conditions are true.
      </li>
    </ul>

      Step 10: Classroom Exercise CE-DT-02
    </h4>
    <p>
      In this step, let’s do a simple exercise with <code>if</code>,
      <code>else</code> and <code>elif</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before getting to the exercise, let’s try and learn how to get console
      input from the user.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until now, we had been hard-coding all the data we were to use. Let’s make
      that part more dynamic now.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Snippet-01:</strong></p>
    <p>
      How do we get input from the user? We want to get input from the console,
      and assign it to a variable. The way we can do that, is by statement
      <code>value = input()</code>
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    value = input(&quot;Enter a Value: &quot;)
    print(&quot;you entered &quot;, value)</code></pre>
    <p>
      We can call the <code>input()</code> method with a text ‘prompt’, such as
      <code>"Enter A Value: "</code>. What we can initially do here, is print
      the value which was entered, back to the console, by
      <code>print("you entered ", integer_value)</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      An interesting point to explore here, is the type of data input at the
      console.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s do a <code>print(type(value))</code>.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    value = input(&quot;Enter a Value: &quot;)
    print(&quot;you entered &quot;, value)
    print(type(value))</code></pre>
    <p>
      Input a value of <code>Test</code>. It has a class of <code>str</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s run it again to see other possibilities. This time, let’s enter a
      numeric value, say <code>12</code>. what would happen?
    </p>
    <p>We again get <code>str</code>.</p>
    <p>We want to get an integer value from the input. How can we do it?</p>
    <p><code>int()</code> function converts string to int. Let’s use it.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>value = input(&quot;Enter a Value: &quot;)
integer_value = int(value)
print(&quot;you entered &quot;, integer_value)
print(type(integer_value))</code></pre>
    <p>Let’s run our code once again.</p>
    <p>
      <code>"Enter A Value: "</code> is prompted, and we enter <code>15</code>.
      And now, of it says <code>"You entered 15"</code>, and the type it
      indicates to us, is <code>int</code>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Design a menu</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ask the User for input:
        <ul>
          <li>Enter two numbers</li>
          <li>
            Choose the Option:
            <ul>
              <li>1 - Add</li>
              <li>2 - Subtract</li>
              <li>3 - Multiply</li>
              <li>4 - Divide</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Perform the Operation</li>
      <li>Publish the Result</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let’s design a menu, and then ask the user for input.</p>
    <p>
      We have codes for each of the operations : add is <code>1</code>, subtract
      is <code>2</code>, divide is <code>3</code>, and multiply is
      <code>4</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first version of the program let’s get all the inputs and print
      them out.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
    <p>The first version of the program is simple to write</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>number1 = int(input(&quot;Enter Number1: &quot;))
number2 = int(input(&quot;Enter Number2: &quot;))
print(f&quot;You entered {number1}&quot;)
print(f&quot;You entered {number2}&quot;)
print(number1 + number2)
print(&quot;\n\n1 - Add&quot;)
print(&quot;2 - Subtract&quot;)
print(&quot;3 - Divide&quot;)
print(&quot;4 - Multiply&quot;)
print(&quot;5 - Exit&quot;)
choice = int(input(&quot;Choose Operation: &quot;))
print(choice)</code></pre>
    <p>We will continue this exercise to complete it, in the next step.</p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>In this step, we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Looked at the in-built <code>input()</code> function that can read
        console input
      </li>
      <li>
        Learned that <code>input()</code> always returns what the user enters,
        as a string
      </li>
      <li>
        We can convert the string from <code>input()</code>, to the data type we
        expect by invoking conversion functions
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Exercises</strong></p>
    <p>
      In the previous step, we got the input from the user. Let’s continue the
      exercise in this step. We want to write an if condition.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Solution (Continued)</strong></p>
    <p>
      Extending the solution is easy. Write appropriate <code>if</code>,
      <code>elif</code> and <code>else</code> conditions.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>number1 = int(input(&quot;Enter Number1: &quot;))
number2 = int(input(&quot;Enter Number2: &quot;))

print(&quot;\n\n1 - Add&quot;)
print(&quot;2 - Subtract&quot;)
print(&quot;3 - Divide&quot;)
print(&quot;4 - Multiply&quot;)

choice = int(input(&quot;Choose Operation: &quot;))

# print(number1 + number2)
# print(choice)
if choice==1:
    result = number1 + number2
elif choice==2:
    result = number1 - number2
elif choice==3:
    result = number1 / number2
elif choice==4:
    result = number1 * number2
else:
    result = &quot;Invalid Choice&quot;

print(result)</code></pre>
    <p>We added the following code to account for invalid input.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>else:
    result = &quot;Invalid Choice&quot;</code></pre>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>In this step, we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Augmented the Menu Exercise to get all the input from the console, and
        compute a value from them
      </li>

    <h4 id="step-12-puzzles-on-conditionals">
      Step 12: Puzzles On Conditionals
    </h4>
    <p>
      In this step, let’s look at a few puzzles related to these
      <code>if</code>, <code>elif</code> and <code>else</code> clauses.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Puzzle-01</strong></p>
    <p>Let’s start with the first puzzle. Guess the output.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>k = 15
if (k &gt; 20):
  print(1)
elif (k &gt; 10):
  print(2)
elif (k &lt; 20):
  print(3)
else:
  print(4)</code></pre>
    <p>When we run it, you can see that the output is <code>2</code>.</p>
    <p>
      <code>k</code> has a value of <code>15</code>, is it greater than
      <code>20</code>? No! Execution goes to the <code>elif</code>, is
      <code>k</code> greater then <code>10</code>? Yes. It prints
      <code>2</code> and goes out of the complete <code>if</code>-<code
        >else</code
      >
      block.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the <code>if</code> conditional, the <code>if</code>,
      <code>elif</code> and <code>else</code> clauses are all independent ones.
      Only one matching block is ever executed.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Puzzle-02</strong></p>
    <p>
      What do you think would be the output of this particular piece of code?
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>l = 15
    if (l &lt; 20):
        print(&quot;l&lt;20&quot;)
if (l &gt; 20):
    print(&quot;l&gt;20&quot;)
else:
    print(&quot;Who am I?&quot;)</code></pre>
    <p>
      Note that there are two totally different <code>if</code> conditions in
      here : <code>if l &lt; 20: ...</code> immediately followed by<code
        >if l &gt; 20: ... else: ...</code
      >.
    </p>
    <p>The first <code>if</code> is true. <code>l&lt;20</code> is printed.</p>
    <p>
      The second <code>if</code> is a separate statement. The condition is
      false. So. <code>else</code> gets executed. Therefore,
      <code>"who am I"</code> gets printed.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Puzzle-03</strong></p>
    <p>Let’s run this code.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>m = 15
if m&gt;20:
    if m&lt;20:
        print(&quot;m&gt;20&quot;)
    else:
        print(&quot;Who am I?&quot;)</code></pre>
    <p>You can see that nothing is printed.</p>
    <p>The most important thing to focus on here, is indentation.</p>
    <p>
      The second <code>if</code> block is executed only if the first
      <code>if</code> is true.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Puzzle-04</strong></p>
    <p>What would be the output?</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>number = 5
if number &lt; 0:
  number = number + 10
number = number + 5
print(number)</code></pre>
    <p><code>10</code> is printed.</p>
    <p>The most important thing to focus on here, is indentation.</p>
    <p>
      Only <code>number = number + 10</code> is part of <code>if</code> block.
      It is not executed because the condition is false.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>number = number + 5</code> is not part of <code>if</code>. So, it
      gets executed.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s add a couple of spaces before <code>number = number + 5</code>.</p>
    <p>What would be the output?</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>number = 5
if number &lt; 0:
  number = number + 10
  number = number + 5
print(number)</code></pre>
    <p><code>5</code> is printed.</p>
    <p>
      Both the statements <code>number = number + 10</code> and
      <code>number = number + 5</code> are part of <code>if</code> block. They
      are not executed because the condition is false.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>In this step, we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Looked at a few puzzles related to <code>if</code>,
        <code>elif</code> and <code>else</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Explored the importance of indentation and the different condition
        clauses inside an <code>if</code> statement

    </ul>
    <h4 id="step-01-the-python-type-to-denote-text">
      Step 01: The Python Type To Denote Text
    </h4>
    <p>
      Let’s start looking at another important data type in Python, that’s used
      to represent strings. Not surprisingly, it is in fact named
      <code>str</code>!
    </p>
    <p>Let’s look at valid string representations.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; message = &quot;Hello World&quot;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; message = &#39;Hello World&#39;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; message = &#39;Hello World&quot;
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1
        message = &#39;Hello World&quot;                          ^
     SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal</code></pre>
    <p>
      In Python, you can use either ```<code>or</code>""` to delimit string
      values.
    </p>
    <p><code>type()</code> method can be used to find type of a variable.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; message = &quot;Hello World&quot;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; type(message)
    &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
      The <code>str</code> <code>class</code> provides a lot of utility methods.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; message.upper()
    &#39;HELLO WORLD&#39;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; message.lower()
    &#39;hello world&#39;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; message = &quot;hello&quot;</code></pre>
    <p>
      <code>message.capitalize()</code> does init caps. Only first character is
      changed to uppercase.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;hello&quot;.capitalize()
    &#39;Hello&#39;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;hello&#39;.capitalize()
    &#39;Hello&#39;</code></pre>
    <p>
      You can also run this directly - <code>'hello'.capitalize()</code>. Isn’t
      that cool!
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s because each piece of text in python is an object of the
      <code>str</code> <code>class</code>, and we can directly call methods of
      that <code>class</code> on <code>str</code> objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let’s shift our attention to methods, which gives us more information
      about the specific contents of a string.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>We want to find out if this string contains numeric values?</li>
      <li>Does it contain alphabets only?</li>
      <li>Does it contain alpha-numeric values?</li>
      <li>Is it lowercase?</li>
      <li>Is it uppercase?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To find if a piece of text contains only lower case alphabets.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;hello&#39;.islower()
    True
    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;Hello&#39;.islower()
    False</code></pre>
    <p>
      If the first letter is in uppercase, then <code>istitle()</code> will
      return a <code>True</code> value.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;Hello&#39;.istitle()
    True
    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;hello&#39;.istitle()
    False</code></pre>
    <p>To find if a piece of text contains only upper case alphabets.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;hello&#39;.isupper()
    False
    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;Hello&#39;.isupper()
    False
    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;HELLO&#39;.isupper()
    True</code></pre>
    <p><code>isdigit()</code> checks if a string is a numeric value.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;123&#39;.isdigit()
    True
    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;A23&#39;.isdigit()
    False
    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;2 3&#39;.isdigit()
    False
    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;23&#39;.isdigit()
    True</code></pre>
    <p><code>isalpha()</code> checks if a string only contains alphabets.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;23&#39;.isalpha()
    False
    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;2A&#39;.isalpha()
    False
    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;ABC&#39;.isalpha()
    True</code></pre>
    <p>
      <code>isalnum()</code> checks if a string only contains alphabets and/or
      numerals.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;ABC123&#39;.isalnum()
    True
    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;ABC 123&#39;.isalnum()
    False</code></pre>
    <p>
      Lastly, we look at things which you can use, to check characters of a
      string.
    </p>
    <p><code>endswith</code> is self explanatory.</p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;Hello World&#39;.endswith(&#39;World&#39;)
    True
    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;Hello World&#39;.endswith(&#39;ld&#39;)
    True
    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;Hello World&#39;.endswith(&#39;old&#39;)
    False
    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;Hello World&#39;.endswith(&#39;Wo&#39;)
    False</code></pre>
    <p><code>startswith</code> is self explanatory as well.</p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;Hello World&#39;.startswith(&#39;Wo&#39;)
    False
    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;Hello World&#39;.startswith(&#39;He&#39;)
    True
    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;Hello World&#39;.startswith(&#39;Hell0&#39;)
    False
    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;Hello World&#39;.startswith(&#39;Hello&#39;)
    True</code></pre>
    <p>
      <code>find</code> method returns if a piece of text is present in another
      string. Returns the first match index.
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;Hello World&#39;.find(&#39;Hello&#39;)
    0
    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;Hello World&#39;.find(&#39;ello&#39;)
    1</code></pre>
    <p>
      A value of <code>-1</code> is returned, if you’re searching for something
      which is not present in the string.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are searching for <code>'Ello'</code> with a capital
      <code>'E'</code> ,you’ll not be able to find it. Search is case sensitive.
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;Hello World&#39;.find(&#39;Ello&#39;)

    <p>
      We’ll now try and convert values from one type to another, and try and
      play around with them.
    </p>
    <p><code>str</code> converts boolean value to a text value.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; str(True)
    &#39;True&#39;</code></pre>
    <p>
      All text value except for empty string represent True. So,
      <code>bool</code> returns True for everything except empty string.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>
      In this quick step, we looked at converting different types to strings,
      and converting strings to different types. So we looked at
      <code>int</code>, <code>bool</code> and <code>float</code> values, and we
      looked at how to convert them to string, and how to convert strings back
      to these specific types.

    <h4 id="step-02-strings-are-immutable">Step 02: Strings Are Immutable</h4>
    <p>In this step, let’s learn an important fact about strings in Python.</p>
    <p>String values are immutable.</p>
    <p>What does immutability mean, and why do we say strings are immutable?</p>
    <p>
      Let’s create a very simple string: <code>message = 'Hello'</code>, and
      we’re saying <code>message.upper()</code>. But what does it do? It prints
      <code>'HELLO'</code>, with all characters in uppercase. Well, what would
      happen if you do <code>print(message)</code>? It says
      <code>'Hello'</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; message = &quot;Hello&quot;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; message.upper()
    &#39;HELLO&#39;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; message
    &#39;Hello&#39;</code></pre>
    <p>
      You would see we tried change the content of message, but it has not
      changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we execute <code>message.upper()</code>, a new string is created, and
      it is returned back. Original string remained unchanged. This is called
      immutability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you define a string in Python, you’ll not be able to change the value
      of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use - “OK. I can do something of this kind:
      <code>message = message.upper()</code>”.
    </p>
    <p>What would happen now?</p>
    <p>
      Will the value of <code>message</code> get changed? It prints
      <code>'HELLO'</code>, with all caps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did the value of <code>message</code> change? Does this prove that strings
      are mutable?
    </p>
    <p>
      The important thing you need to understand about all this stuff, is how
      objects are stored inside Python.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are things called variables, and there are things called objects.
    </p>
    <p>When we run <code>message = 'Hello'</code></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We are creating one object of <code>str</code> class with a values
        <code>'Hello'</code>.
      </li>
      <li>We are creating one variable called <code>message</code></li>
      <li>
        The location of <code>'Hello'</code> is stored into <code>message</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In Python, your variables are nothing but a name.</p>
    <p>
      If location of <code>'Hello'</code> in memory is <code>A</code>, then the
      value stored in <code>message</code> is <code>A</code>.
      <code>message</code> is called a reference.
    </p>
    <p>What happens with <code>message = message.upper()</code>?</p>
    <p>
      A new object is created with value <code>'HELLO'</code> at a different
      location <code>B</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A reference ot location <code>B</code> is stored into
      <code>message</code> variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summary : The original value at location <code>A</code> has not changed
      and cannot be changed for <code>str</code> variables. Hence ‘str’ objects
      are immutable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Variables are just names referring to a location. They don’t really
      contain the value. Variables contain a reference to the location that
      contains the object.
    </p>
    <h4 id="step-03-python-has-no-separate-character-type">
      Step 03: Python Has No Separate Character Type
    </h4>
    <p>
      One of the things that surprises people new to Python, is that there is no
      character data type in Python.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically we have text data types in all the languages, don’t we?
      <code>'Hello World'</code> for example, is text data, and we stored it in
      <code>message</code>. This is called a string.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other languages, you would have something to represent a single
      character symbol. For example in Java, you can have a
      <code>char</code> data type, to store a single character <code>ch</code>,
      in which <code>'h'</code> is one character. But in Python, there is no
      separate data type to store single characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, let’s see how Python treats the first character of the
      following string <code>message</code>. The way you can access the first
      character of a string is by saying <code>message[0]</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; message = &quot;Hello World&quot;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; message[0]
    &#39;H&#39;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; type(message[0])
    &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; type(message)
    &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
      <code>type(message[0])</code> and <code>type(message)</code> print the
      same type <code>str</code>. No difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Python, whether you’re talking about a string, or you’re talking about
      a single character symbol, they are all represented by the same
      <code>class</code>, <code>str</code>.
    </p>
    <p><code>message[100]</code> throws an <code>IndexError</code>.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; message[0]
    &#39;H&#39;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; message[1]
    &#39;e&#39;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; message[2]
    &#39;l&#39;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; message[3]
    &#39;l&#39;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; message[100]
    IndexError: string index out of range</code></pre>
    <p>
      It says: “The given index is out of the range of the value of that
      specific string”.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s say we would want to print all the characters in this string.</p>
    <p>
      The way you could do that, is by saying:
      <code>for ch in message: print(ch)</code>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>
      In this short step, we looked at the fact that there is no separate
      character class, or data type in Python. We also looked at how do we loop
      over a given string, and print all the characters present inside this
      string.
    </p>
    <h4 id="step-04-the-string-module">
      Step 04: The <code>string</code> <code>module</code>
    </h4>
    <p>
      In this step, we will introduce you to the <code>string</code>
      <code>module</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we would want to use anything from a module in Python, you need to
      import that specific <code>module</code> into your program.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; import string</code></pre>

    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>
      In this step, we explored more exercises involving the
      <code>str</code> module of Python.
    </p>
    <h4 id="step-05-more-exercises-with-the-str-module">
      Step 05: More Exercises With The <code>str</code> Module
    </h4>
    <p>
      Let’s start with an Exercise - find if a specific character is a vowel or
      not.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; char = &#39;a&#39;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; vowel_string = &#39;aeiouAEIOU&#39;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; char in vowel_string
    True
    &gt;&gt;&gt; char = &#39;b&#39;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; char in vowel_string
    False</code></pre>
    <p>
      he other thing you can do, is just have the capital vowels, or just the
      lowercase versions.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; vowel_string = &#39;AEIOU&#39;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; char.upper() in vowel_string
    False
    &gt;&gt;&gt; char = &#39;a&#39;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; char.upper() in vowel_string
    True</code></pre>
    <p>Now let’s move on to the next one.</p>
    <p>
      We want to find out and print all the capital alphabets, from
      <code>A</code> to <code>Z</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a small clue at the start of the previous step, regarding
      importing the <code>string</code> <code>module</code>. We did the
      <code>string</code> <code>module</code>, and we saw that
      <code>string</code> <code>module</code> contained a number of things.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; string.ascii_uppercase
    &#39;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&#39;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for char in string.ascii_uppercase:
    ...   print(char)
    ...
    A
    B

    O
    P
    Q
    R
    S
    T
    U
    V
    W
    X
    Y
    Z</code></pre>
    <p>
      Try another easy exercise: print all the lower characters. Instead of
      <code>string.ascii_uppercase</code>, you have
      <code>string.ascii_lowercase</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for char in string.ascii_lowercase:
    ...   print(char)
    ...
    a
    b

    g
    h

    s
    t
    u
    v
    w

    z</code></pre>
    <p>An even easier exercise, would be to print all the digits.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for char in string.
    string.Formatter(       string.ascii_uppercase  string.octdigits

    &gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
      The last exercise which we want to leave you with, is to check if
      something is a consonant.
    </p>
    <p>
      A consonant is an alphabet which is not a vowel, so any alphabet which is
      not in <code>'aeiou'</code> is a consonant. The simplest way of doing this
      is to say <code>consonant_string = 'bcdfghj...'</code> and so on. Looks
      like a very long solution? There is an easier way out.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; vowel_string = &#39;aeiou&#39;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; char = &#39;b&#39;

    True</code></pre>
    <h4 id="step-06-more-exercises-on-strings">
      Step 06: More Exercises On Strings
    </h4>
    <p>
      In the step, let’s look at a few more puzzles and exercises related to
      strings. Let’s say we have a simple string, <code>string_example</code>,
      and this is contains an English sentence.
      <code>'This is a great thing.'</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s try to to print each of the words present in this string, on a
      separate line.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we would want to print <code>'This'</code>, <code>'is'</code>,
      <code>'a'</code>, <code>'great'</code> and <code>'thing'</code> on
      individual lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the clues we’ll give you is, try and do
      <code>string_example. &lt;TAB&gt;</code>. There are a huge list of
      methods, which would come up if you do that.
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; string_example = &quot;This is a great thing&quot;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; string_example.
    string_example.capitalize(    string_example.join(
    string_example.casefold(      string_example.ljust(
    string_example.center(        string_example.lower(
    string_example.count(         string_example.lstrip(
    string_example.encode(        string_example.maketrans(
    string_example.endswith(      string_example.partition(
    string_example.expandtabs(    string_example.replace(
    string_example.find(          string_example.rfind(
    string_example.format(        string_example.rindex(
    string_example.format_map(    string_example.rjust(
    string_example.index(         string_example.rpartition(
    string_example.isalnum(       string_example.rsplit(
    string_example.isalpha(       string_example.rstrip(
    string_example.isdecimal(     string_example.split(
    string_example.isdigit(       string_example.splitlines(
    string_example.isidentifier(  string_example.startswith(
    string_example.islower(       string_example.strip(
    string_example.isnumeric(     string_example.swapcase(
    string_example.isprintable(   string_example.title(
    string_example.isspace(       string_example.translate(
    string_example.istitle(       string_example.upper(
    string_example.isupper(       string_example.zfill(</code></pre>
    <p>One of the methods in the list is the <code>split()</code> method.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; string_example.split()
    [&#39;This&#39;, &#39;is&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;great&#39;, &#39;thing&#39;]
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for word in string_example.split():
    ...    print(word)
    ...
    This
    is
    a
    great
    thing</code></pre>
    <p>
      <code>split_lines()</code> method looks for a <code>'\n'</code>, and it
      divides the string based on it. If you have a string which contains
      newlines, and you would want to divide it into a number of strings with
      each line as a new element, the method you can use is
      <code>split_lines()</code>.
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; string_example = &quot;This\nis\n\ngreat\nthing&quot;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(string_example)
    This
    is

    great
    thing
    &gt;&gt;&gt; string_example = &quot;This\nis\na\ngreat\nthing&quot;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(string_example)
    This
    is
    a
    great
    thing
    &gt;&gt;&gt; string_example.splitlines()
    [&#39;This&#39;, &#39;is&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;great&#39;, &#39;thing&#39;]
    &gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
      The last thing which we look at, is
      <strong>concatenation operator</strong>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; 1 + 2
    3
    &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;1&quot; + &quot;2&quot;
    &#39;12&#39;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;1&quot; + 1
    TypeError: must be str, not int
    &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;ABC&quot; + &quot;DEF&quot;
    &#39;ABCDEF&#39;</code></pre>
    <p>
      In Python, you cannot do <code>+</code> operator between two different
      types. <code>+</code> with two strings is concatenation.
      <code>+</code> with two numbers is addition.
    </p>
    <p>
      One other interesting operator on strings is multiplication. If you do a
      <code>'1' * 20</code>, What do you think will be the output?
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; 1 * 20
    20
    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;1&#39; * 20
    &#39;11111111111111111111&#39;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;A&#39; * 10
    &#39;AAAAAAAAAA&#39;</code></pre>
    <p>
      If you multiply a string with <code>number</code>, the string value is
      concatenated <code>number</code> times.
    </p>
    <p>The last thing which we look at in this step, is comparing strings.</p>
    <p>
      Let’s say we have a string with a value <code>str = 'test'</code>, and you
      have another string to with a value <code>str1 = 'test1'</code>.
    </p>
    <p>We want to check whether both these strings are the same.</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; str = &quot;test&quot;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; str2 = &quot;test1&quot;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; str == str2
    False
    &gt;&gt;&gt; str2 = &quot;test&quot;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; str == str2
    True</code></pre>
    <p>You can compare strings using the <code>==</code> operator.</p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>
      In this step, we explored a few exercises on strings, covering areas such
      as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Splitting a given sentence into individual words</li>
      <li>The concatenation operator, <code>+</code></li>
      <li>The string multiplication pattern, <code>*</code></li>

    <p>
      Let’s start with revising the basics of the for loop, we have learned in
      the previous steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      We saw that a <code>for</code> loop helps us to loop around the same set
      of code statements, many times over.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s look at a few simple examples, once again.</p>
    <p><strong>Snippet-01</strong></p>
    <p>The syntax of a <code>for</code> loop is very simple.</p>
    <p>
      For example, this code snippet will tell you all about it:
      <code>for i in range(1, 11): print(i)</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      What does this do? Very simple, it prints from <code>1</code> to
      <code>10</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the call to the <code>range()</code> function, the second parameter is
      exclusive. We are actually looping from <code>1</code> to <code>10</code>,
      and this piece of code, <code>print(i)</code>, is being executed for
      different values of <code>i</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(1,11):
    ...   print(i)
    ...
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9
    10</code></pre>
    <p>
      <code>for</code> loop can also be used to loop round the characters in a
      string.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for ch in &quot;Hello World&quot;:
    ...   print(ch)
    ...
    H
    e
    l
    l
    o
    W
    o
    r
    l
    d</code></pre>
    <p>
      <code>for</code> loop can be used to loop around all the words in a given
      sentence.
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for word in &quot;Hello World&quot;.split():
    ...   print(word)
    ...
    Hello
    World</code></pre>
    <p>
      <code>for</code> loop can be used to loop around a specific list of
      values.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for item in (3, 6, 9):
    ...   print(item)
    ...
    3
    6
    9</code></pre>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>
      In this step, we started with discussing and revising basic concepts about
      the <code>for</code> loop

      Step 02: Programming Exercise PE-LO-01
    </h4>
    <p>
      Welcome back to this step, where we would do a lot of exercises with the
      <code>for</code> loop.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Exercises</strong></p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        The first exercise is to find out if a number is prime. We want to write
        a method, <code>is_prime()</code>, which accepts an integer value as
        parameter, and returns whether it’s a prime. (<strong>Hint</strong>: A
        prime number is something which is only divisible by <code>1</code> and
        itself).
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <code>5</code> is only divisible by <code>1</code> and
            <code>5</code>. It is not divisible by any other number. Same is the
            case with <code>7</code> and <code>11</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            However, <code>6</code> is divisible by <code>1</code>,
            <code>2</code>, <code>3</code> and <code>6</code>. So it’s not a
            prime number.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        The second exercise is to write a method to calculate the sum up to a
        given integer, starting from <code>1</code>. <strong>Hint</strong>: If I
        would want to find that the sum up to <code>6</code>. what’s needed is
        <code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The third exercise is to find that the sum of divisors of a given
        integer. <strong>Hint</strong>: Let’s say we want to find out the sum of
        the divisors of <code>15</code>. The divisors of <code>15</code> are
        <code>1</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>5</code> and <code>15</code>. So I
        would want to calculate <code>1 + 3 + 5 + 15</code>, and return that
        value.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fourth exercise is to print a numbered triangle, when given a specific
        integer.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Hint: Given an input <code>5</code>, we would want to print the number
      triangle of these kind:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5.</code></pre>
    <p>
      These are the exercises for the <code>for</code> loop. We also test our
      skills, with creating method and executing them, in our IDE.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Solution 1</strong></p>
    <p>
      Let’s start with creating the <code>is_prime()</code> method, in a file
      named <code>for_exercises</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We would want to accept an <code>int</code> parameter, and find out if it
      is prime, or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      We need to check whether it’s divisible by any other number, other than
      <code>1</code> and itself. If we are passed in a value of <code>5</code>,
      you want to see if it’s divisible by any of <code>2</code>,
      <code>3</code> or <code>4</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>def is_prime(number):</code></pre>
    <p>
      We can use a <code>for</code> loop. We can structure it like this:
      <code>for divisor in range(1, number): ...</code>. We would not want to
      divide it with <code>1</code>, but start with <code>2</code> instead, and
      go up to <code>number-1</code>, which is <code>4</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>for divisor in range(2,number):</code></pre>
    <p>
      How can we check if the <code>number</code> is divisible by
      <code>divisor</code>?
    </p>
    <p>
      By using the <code>%</code> operator. If <code>number</code> is divisible
      by <code>divisor</code> we return <code>False</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>for divisor in range(2,number):
    if number % divisor == 0:
        return False</code></pre>
    <p>
      What happens if the code comes up to the end? It would mean we tried with
      <code>2</code>, <code>3</code> and <code>4</code>, but
      <code>number</code> was not divisible by all of them. In that case,
      <code>number</code> would be prime, and we can safely return
      <code>True</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>for divisor in range(2,number):
    if number % divisor == 0:
        return False

return True</code></pre>
    <p>
      For <code>1</code>, the rules are a little different, as it is neither a
      prime or composite. We will add an <code>if</code> condition to check if
      the number is <code>1</code>. <code>if(number &lt; 2):</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This <code>if</code> condition is called a guard check or a boundary
      check, to make sure that you are processing only the right input. If
      <code>number</code> has a value less than <code>2</code>, do nothing. OK,
      it’s not a prime.
    </p>
    <p>Here is the entire code at one place, for your reference:</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>def is_prime(number):
    if(number &lt; 2):
        return False
    for divisor in range(2,number):
        if number % divisor == 0:
            return False
    return True
print(is_prime(5));</code></pre>
    <h4 id="step-03-continued---programming-exercise-pe-lo-01">
      Step 03: Continued - Programming Exercise PE-LO-01
    </h4>
    <p>
      In the previous step, we looked at solving the
      <code>is_prime()</code> exercise. In this step, let’s look at an
      implementation of <code>sum_up_to_n()</code>. Here is the entire code for
      this exercise:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>def sum_upto_n(number):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, number+1):
        sum = sum + i
    return sum
print(sum_upto_n(6))
print(sum_upto_n(10))</code></pre>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>In this step, we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Wrote a Python function to compute the sum of all integers, from
        <code>1</code>, up to the input integer <code>n</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="step-04-continued---programming-exercise-pe-lo-01">
      Step 04: Continued - Programming Exercise PE-LO-01
    </h4>
    <p>Let’s focus on the third exercise, <code>sum_of_divisors</code>.</p>
    <p>
      One of the clues we can give you, is that
      <code>sum_of_divisors()</code> is very similar to <code>is_prime()</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You want to find out if a number is dividing <code>15</code>, and if it’s
      dividing <code>15</code>, with the remainder of <code>0</code>, then you
      need to add that up.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>def calculate_sum_of_divisors(number):
    sum = 0
    if(number &lt; 2):
        return sum
    for divisor in range(1,number+1):
        if number % divisor == 0:
            sum = sum + divisor
    return sum
print(calculate_sum_of_divisors(6))
print(calculate_sum_of_divisors(15))</code></pre>
    <h4 id="step-05-continued---programming-exercise-pe-lo-01">
      Step 05: Continued - Programming Exercise PE-LO-01
    </h4>
    <p>
      In this step, Let’s look at the last exercise -
      <code>print_a_number_triangle</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if we call such a function with input <code>5</code>, the
      output needs to be:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>1

1 2

1 2 3

1 2 3 4

1 2 3 4 5</code></pre>
    <p>
      Let start with a simple thing. Let’s try and print
      <code>1 2 3 4 5</code> first, and then we would look at how to print the
      rest of the output. Lets proceed with defining this method.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can say <code>def print_a_number_triangle(number): ...</code> that
      takes a number as an input. You want to print a sequence of integers
      starting from <code>1</code>, up to that specific <code>number</code>. How
      can you do that? Let’s try this:
      <code>for i in range(1,number+1): print(i)</code> What would happen? Let’s
      call <code>print_a_number_triangle(5)</code> now. It prints:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    1
    2
    3
    4
    5</code></pre>
    <p>on individual lines.</p>
    <p>
      To print this sequence on a single line, let’s delimit them with
      <code>&lt;SPACE&gt;</code> instead. Call <code>print()</code> like this
      instead: <code>for i in range(1,number+1): print(i, end=" ")</code>.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s see what would happen now. <code>1 2 3 4 5</code></p>
    <p>To solve our exercise, we want to repeat this again and again.</p>
    <p>Yes, we need another for loop around it!</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>for j in range(1, number+1):
    for i in range(1, number + 1):
        print(i, end=&quot; &quot;)</code></pre>
    <p>
      Make sure that you have the indentation right. This is called
      <code>loop within a loop</code>.
    </p>
    <p>The output of above program is</p>
    <p><code>1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5</code></p>
    <p>
      Let’s add <code>print("\n")</code>, so we have a new line at the end of
      each outer loop iteration.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>for j in range(1, number+1):
    for i in range(1, number + 1):
        print(i, end=&quot; &quot;)
    print(&quot;\n&quot;)</code></pre>
    <p>Output</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5</code></pre>
    <p>We are printing a square, not a triangle.</p>
    <p>
      What we want to do is to print up to <code>1</code> in first line, upto
      <code>2</code> in second line and so on.
    </p>
    <p>How can we do that? Think about it.</p>
    <p>
      When you are inside this loop, you can see the variable <code>j</code>.
    </p>
    <p>Instead of <code>number+1</code>, let’s say <code>j + 1</code>.</p>
    <p>
      When <code>j</code> has a value of <code>1</code>, <code>for</code> will
      print from <code>1</code> to <code>1</code>. When <code>j</code> has a
      value of <code>2</code>, print from <code>1</code> to <code>2</code>,
      literally printing <code>1 2</code>. When j has a value of <code>3</code>,
      I’ll print from <code>1</code> to <code>3</code>. Let’s try this and see
      what would happen.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>for j in range(1, number+1):
    for i in range(1, j + 1):
        print(i, end=&quot; &quot;)
    print(&quot;\n&quot;)</code></pre>
    <p>You can see that our number triangle is ready!</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>1

1 2

1 2 3

1 2 3 4

1 2 3 4 5</code></pre>
    <p>Here is the entire code for you:</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>def print_a_number_triangle(number):
    for j in range(1, number + 1):
        for i in range(1, j + 1):
            print(i, end=&#39; &#39;)
        print()
print_a_number_triangle(6)</code></pre>
    <p>
      An important point to note is, a couple of these things can be done in a
      much simpler way. We will look at these options when we talk about
      functional programming.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>In this step, we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Presented a solution to the exercise for printing a number triangle.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="step-06-introducing-the-while-loop">
      Step 06: Introducing The while Loop
    </h4>
    <p>
      Let’s look at one of the other loops which is present in Python, called
      the <strong><code>while</code></strong> loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the <code>for</code> loop, we can specify the range of our iteration,
      by using the <code>range()</code> function.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a <code>while</code> loop, we specify a logical condition. While the
      condition is true, loop continues running.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you remember one place where we use the condition until now? It was in
      an <code>if</code> statement.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s see how to use a simple <code>while</code> loop.</p>
    <p><strong>Snippet-01:</strong></p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; i = 5
    &gt;&gt;&gt; if i == 5:
    ...   print(&quot;i is 5&quot;)
    ...
    i is 5</code></pre>
    <p>
      Let’s say <code>i</code> has a value of <code>0</code>, and we then do:
      <code>while i &lt; 5: print(i)</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; i = 0
    &gt;&gt;&gt; while i &lt; 5:
    ...   print(i)
    ...
    0
    0
    0
    0
    0
    0
    0
    0
    ^CTraceback (most recent call last):
      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
    KeyboardInterrupt
    &gt;&gt;&gt;
    KeyboardInterrupt</code></pre>
    <p>
      If we leave it to run, you’d see that it continuously prints
      <code>0</code> again, and again. Let’s do a <code>&lt;CTRL-C&gt;</code> or
      <code>&lt;COMMAND-C&gt;</code> to interrupt this.
    </p>
    <p>What is happening here?</p>
    <p>
      Initially <code>i</code> is <code>0</code>, and the condition
      <code>i &lt; 5</code> is <code>True</code>, and <code>print(i)</code> is
      executed. Next iteration, it checks the condition, it is
      <code>True</code>, and <code>0</code> is printed. This continues to
      happen. What’s happening is an <strong>infinite loop</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the important things to make sure in a <code>while</code> loop, is
      to increment the value of <code>i</code>. We need to say something like
      <code>i = i + 1</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; while i &lt; 5:
    ...   print(i)
    ...   i = i + 1
    ...
    0
    1
    2
    3
    4</code></pre>
    <p>
      So how does it work? *<code>i</code> initially had a value of
      <code>0</code>. First the condition is checked. It’s <code>True</code>, so
      <code>0</code> is printed and then the value of <code>i</code> is
      incremented to <code>1</code>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>i</code> is still less than <code>5</code>, so the loop continues
        to execute, and this happens until <code>4</code> is printed.
        <code>i</code> again gets incremented to <code>4 + 1</code>, or
        <code>5</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then we check the condition <code>i &lt; 5</code>. This is now
        <code>False</code>. Control goes out of the <code>while</code> loop, and
        terminates it.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When executing a <code>while</code>, control flow is just based on a
      condition. As long as the condition is <code>True</code>, we keep
      executing the code. An important thing to remember, is to make sure the
      control variable is updated.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(0,5): print(i)
    ...
    0
    1
    2
    3
    4</code></pre>
    <p>
      A <code>for</code> loop is much simpler to code than a <code>while</code>.
      With <code>while</code>, we have to write an expression statement, to
      increment the value.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question you might have is - What are the situations when you should
      use a while?
    </p>
    <p>We will look at that very soon.</p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>In this video, we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Were introduced to the concept of a <code>while</code> loop in Python
      </li>

        the loop

      Step 07: Programming Exercise PE-LO-02
    </h4>
    <p>
      In the previous step, we were introduced to <code>while</code> loop. In
      this step, let’s look at a couple of exercises using the
      <code>while</code> loop.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Exercises</strong></p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <code>print_squares_upto_limit(30)</code>: We need to print all the
        squares of numbers, up to a limit of <code>30</code>. The output needs
        to be <code>1 4 9 16 25</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>print_cubes_upto_limit(30)</code>: We need to print all the cubes
        of numbers, up to a limit of <code>30</code>.The output needs to be 1 8
        27.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Exercise 1: Solution</strong></p>
    <p>Here is the entire code for your reference:</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>def print_squares_upto_limit(limit):
    i = 1
    while i * i &lt; limit:
        print(i*i, end = &quot; &quot;)
        i = i + 1</code></pre>
    <p>Now the next exercise, was to print cubes up to a limit.</p>
    <p>
      The expression in the <code>while</code> condition should now be
      <code>i*i*i &lt; 30</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>def print_cubes_upto_limit(limit):
    i = 1
    while i * i * i &lt; limit:
        print(i*i*i, end = &quot; &quot;)
        i = i + 1
print_cubes_upto_limit(80)</code></pre>

      Could we have implemented above two examples with <code>for</code> loop?
      It would’ve been a little more difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically, we use a <code>for</code> loop when we know how many times the
      loop will be executed is clear at the start.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we do not know, how many times a loop will run, <code>while</code> is a
      better option.

      Earlier we used <code>if</code> statement to implement a solution for
      this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ask the User for input:
        <ul>
          <li>Enter two numbers</li>
          <li>
            Choose the Option:
            <ul>
              <li>1 - Add</li>
              <li>2 - Subtract</li>
              <li>3 - Multiply</li>
              <li>4 - Divide</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Perform the Operation</li>
      <li>Publish the Result</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We would want to enhance it to execute in a loop multiple times, until the
      user chooses to exit. We will add an option 5 - Exit.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ask the User for input:
        <ul>
          <li>Enter two numbers</li>
          <li>
            Choose the Option:
            <ul>
              <li>1 - Add</li>
              <li>2 - Subtract</li>
              <li>3 - Multiply</li>
              <li>4 - Divide</li>
              <li>5 - Exit</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Perform the Operation</li>
      <li>Publish the Result</li>
      <li>Repeat until Option 5 is chosen.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Snippet-01 Explained</strong></p>
    <p>Here’s the earlier code we wrote with if:</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>number1 = int(input(&quot;Enter Number1: &quot;))
number2 = int(input(&quot;Enter Number2: &quot;))

print(&quot;\n\n1 - Add&quot;)
print(&quot;2 - Subtract&quot;)
print(&quot;3 - Divide&quot;)
print(&quot;4 - Multiply&quot;)

choice = int(input(&quot;Choose Operation: &quot;))

# print(number1 + number2)
# print(choice)
if choice==1:
    result = number1 + number2
elif choice==2:
    result = number1 - number2
elif choice==3:
    result = number1 / number2
elif choice==4:
    result = number1 * number2
else:
    result = &quot;Invalid Choice&quot;

print(result)</code></pre>
