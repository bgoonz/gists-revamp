###### Bypass WAFs by Shortening IP Address (by [0xInfection](https://twitter.com/0xInfection))

IP addresses can be shortened by dropping the zeroes:

    http://1.0.0.1 → http://1.1
    http://127.0.0.1 → http://127.1
    http://192.168.0.1 → http://192.168.1

    http://0xC0A80001 or http://3232235521 → 192.168.0.1
    http://192.168.257 → 192.168.1.1
    http://192.168.516 → 192.168.2.4

> This bypasses WAF filters for SSRF, open-redirect, etc where any IP as input gets blacklisted.
