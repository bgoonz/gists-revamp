Some things that are "better" with this `BetterPromise` implementation:

* `BetterPromise # then(..)` accepts a `BetterPromise` (or `Promise`) instance passed directly, instead of requiring a function to return it, so that the promise is linked into the chain.

   ```js
   var p = BetterPromise.resolve(42);

   var q = Promise.resolve(10);

   p.then(console.log).then(q).then(console.log);
   // 42
   // 10
   ```

* `BetterPromise # unthen(..)` / `BetterPromise # uncatch(..)` / `BetterPromise # unfinally(..)` allows you to unregister a fulfillment or rejection handler that you previously registered on a promise via `then(..)` or `catch(..)`, or unregister a resolution handler that you previously registered on a promise via `finally(..)`.

   **NOTE:** This seems to be the majority use-case for why many like/want "promise cancelation" -- IOW, often what you want is to just stop observing a promise's resolution, not actually forcibly cancel the operation is comes from.
   
   ```js
   var p = new BetterPromise(function(res){
      setTimeout(function(){ res(42); },100);
   });

   function f1(v) { console.log(`f1: ${v}`); }
   function f2(v) { console.log(`f2: ${v}`); }
   function f3() { console.log("finally!"); }

   p.then(f1);
   p.then(f2);
   p.finally(f3);
   p.unthen(f1);
   p.unfinally(f3);
   // later
   // f2: 42
   ```

* `BetterPromise # finally(..)` is included ([assumed implemented](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/finally) since it's already stage-4). Registers a resolution handler which is called on either fulfillment or rejection, sorta like if you did `then( fn, fn )` (but not exactly).

   ```js
   var p = BetterPromise.resolve(42);
   p
      .finally(function(){ console.log("resolved!"); })
      .then(function(v){ console.log(`still: ${v}`); });
   // resolved!
   // still: 42
   ```

* `BetterPromise # thenLog()` / `BetterPromise # catchLog()` inserts a step in a promise chain that simply prints the value to the console (`console.log` for fulfillment, `console.error` for rejection) and passes the value or rejection along to the next step untouched.

   ```js
   var p = BetterPromise.resolve(42);
   p
     .thenLog()
     .then(function(v){ console.log(`still: ${v}`); });
   // 42
   // still: 42
   ```

* Instead of silently being swallowed, if a synchronous exception is thrown in a `BetterPromise` constructor *after* the promise has already been synchronously *resolved* (fulfillment or rejection), that exception overrides and causes the promise to be rejected with that exception.

   ```js
   var p = new BetterPromise(function(res){
      res(42);
      throw 10;
   });

   p.then(
      function(v){ console.log(`then: ${v}`); },
      function(e){ console.log(`oops: ${e}`); }
   );
   // oops: 10
   ```

* `BetterPromise.try(..)` (static helper) is [implemented (so not just draft)](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-promise-try). Runs a function (with no arguments) synchronously, returns a promise for its return value (or adopts its promise), catches any synchronous exception and turns it into a rejection.

   ```js
   var p = BetterPromise.try(function(){
      undefined(42);
   });
   p.catch(console.log);
   // TypeError: undefined is not a function
   ```

* `BetterPromise.deferred(..)` (static helper) constructs an instance of the promise, but also extracts its `resolve(..)` and `reject(..)` capabilities, and returns all 3 in an object (aka, a "deferred").

   ```js
   var { pr, resolve, reject } = BetterPromise.deferred();

   pr.then(console.log);
   resolve(42);
   // 42
   ```

* `BetterPromise.lift(..)` (static helper) lifts an error-first, callback-last style function to be `BetterPromise` returning instead.

   ```js
   var readFile = BetterPromise.lift(fs.readFile);
   readFile("/path/to/file.txt")
   .then(printContents);
   ```

* `BetterPromise.control(..)` (static helper) wraps a function so that when called, it first creates an `AbortController` instance, passes in its `signal` as the first argument to the original function, and returns a controller object that has both a `pr` for the function's completion, as well as a `cancel(..)` to send the abort signal. Ostensibly, the original function can then observe/respond to that passed-in signal and do something appropriate with it, like canceling its own behavior, passing it to `fetch(..)` to abort an Ajax call, etc.

   ```js
   async function main(signal,url) {
      signal.addEventListener("abort", .. );

      // ..
                                
      var resp = await fetch(url, { signal });
                                    
      // ..
   }

   var fn = BetterPromise.control(main);
   var { pr, cancel } = fn("http://some.url");

   pr.then(..);

   // later
   cancel();  // sends cancelation signal into `fn(..)`
   ```
